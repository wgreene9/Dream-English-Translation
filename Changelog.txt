[b]2.16.2026[/b]
First of all, happy new year to everyone! We are very pleased that The Dream yet to be Dreamed can bring you a brand new Lombardy update during the Spring Festival!

1. New Recommended Nation: Lombardy
Featuring three paths: Republican Faction (Lombardy), Imperial Faction (Milan), Holy Sanctuary Faction (Florence).
Each path has its own ideas, formable nations, special missions, special mechanisms, and special disasters.

[i]A once-great alliance is facing destruction,
A once-united union is falling apart;
Whether its helmsman is willing or not,
This great ship now stands on the highest wave in the storm.
Will it step forward to save the situation from collapse?
Or follow ambition and bring Italy into the fold?
Or place a crown upon the head of the uncrowned king...[/i]

2. Other
- New Event: The Italian Wars. Triggers upon the death of Frederick III of Swabia.
- Created national ideas for Milan and Florence.
- Fixed several bugs related to Valencia.
- When Brandenburg forms the Austrian Confederate State, if conditions are met, the Carniola area will also be granted together.
- The reward for the French mission "Develop the Netherlands" now applies to both the Netherlands and Middle Francia when they are subjects.
- The Andalusian event "Córdoba Edict" will now also convert the culture of subject provinces when converting culture.
- If Andalusia conquers an Islamic province that is a potential corresponding culture assimilation target, cultural assimilation will occur after 5 years (because it is already Islamic and cannot be proselytized).
- Fixed a bug where releasing a Confederation member as France would cause issues if it already existed.
- Removed the Dutch Revolts disaster.
- Devout personalities will no longer appear as a generic trait.
- Doubled the chance for the Sun King personality trait to appear.

The second great war between North and South is imminent. The ultimate victor will indisputably become the hegemon ruling Germany, but how will they heal this divided people and the nations now worlds apart?

Unique Mechanics:
- Kaiser's League (Kaiserbund): Derived from the North German Confederation, this alliance system encompasses 12 reforms that provide bonuses to you and your subject nations. Transform loyal personal unions into Bundesstaat, enjoying unique flavor events for each member state.
- Cultural Integration: Arising from cultural divergence, spread the footprint of the Germanic peoples across Europe. Disseminate German culture throughout the continent, taking the first step towards Germanization.
- League Member (Bundesstaat) System: Evolving from the Imperial Circle system, this allows you to spread the Hohenzollern branches to your subject states. Extend the reach of the Hohenzollern family, planting the seed for a giant tree that will cover Europe.
- Classical Dual Leadership: The Chancellor acts as the Kaiser's proxy. The Kaiser and his Chancellor rule the empire together, ensuring the will of the Kaiser is implemented through the Reichstag and the Federal Diet.

- France's mission tree is disabled when it is a subject/vassal.
