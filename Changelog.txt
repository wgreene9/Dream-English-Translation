The second great war between North and South is imminent. The ultimate victor will indisputably become the hegemon ruling Germany, but how will they heal this divided people and the nations now worlds apart?

Unique Mechanics:
- Kaiser's League (Kaiserbund): Derived from the North German Confederation, this alliance system encompasses 12 reforms that provide bonuses to you and your subject nations. Transform loyal personal unions into Bundesstaat, enjoying unique flavor events for each member state.
- Cultural Integration: Arising from cultural divergence, spread the footprint of the Germanic peoples across Europe. Disseminate German culture throughout the continent, taking the first step towards Germanization.
- League Member (Bundesstaat) System: Evolving from the Imperial Circle system, this allows you to spread the Hohenzollern branches to your subject states. Extend the reach of the Hohenzollern family, planting the seed for a giant tree that will cover Europe.
