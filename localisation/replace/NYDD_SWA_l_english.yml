DD_SWA_1_t: "Frederick's Legacy"
DD_SWA_1_d: "The Hohenstaufen family once possessed vast territories spanning across Europe, but with the decline of the family and internal strife among its members, it is feared that this mighty empire will eventually come to an end. The Kingdom of Sicily, inherited from the House of Hauteville, has always been the most valuable possession of the Hohenstaufen family and the most fiercely contested.\n\nAfter the death of the old Emperor Frederick III, in order to end the endless internal conflicts within the family, his will, witnessed by the Pope and the seven Electors, stipulated that the eldest son of the Hohenstaufen would inherit the Empire, the second son would receive the Kingdom of Sicily, and the youngest son would receive the Duchy of the Low Countries, and the three could not be merged. This will was jointly witnessed by the Holy See and the Electors, sacred and inviolable."

DD_SWA_2_t: "The Imperial Diet of 1444"
DD_SWA_2_d: "Frederick III, now the Holy Roman Emperor, holds numerous titles including the head of the House of Hohenstaufen, Duke of Swabia, King of Sicily, and Duke of Brabant, and has just emerged from a burdensome Imperial Diet. Since the Civil War between the North and the South, and the subsequent Great Schism of the Holy Roman Empire, this assembly has gradually become a place where various factions flatter the Emperor and vie for power and influence. 'A bunch of sycophants,' Frederick III cursed inwardly as he walked out of the council chamber in Aachen. His right-hand man—the Habsburg court steward from Switzerland—and his wife, the Duchess of Bavaria, had been waiting for him for a long time.\n\nAlthough Frederick II successfully integrated the French crown into the Holy Roman Empire and defended the legacy of the Crusades, he failed to dismantle the Lombard League, leaving a significant threat to the Empire and his family. However, this threat will soon be no more, as Frederick III smiled and took the letter handed to him by the court steward, bearing the seal of the Duke of Milan.\n\n'My dear, don't forget to visit Bavaria later to see our child.' Leaving a kiss for the Duchess, Frederick III boarded the carriage for his return journey. Heinrich von Hohenstaufen, his child with the Duchess of Bavaria, now lives in the Bavarian court, and if all goes well, this child will inherit the thrones of the Holy Roman Empire and Bavaria. Thinking of this, Frederick III rubbed his aching forehead again; the Electors were still incessantly urging him to divide the vast Hohenstaufen territories among his children, and even his long-time ally, the Pope, agreed with this. Although it is true that all three children are his flesh and blood, and a vast territory is indeed difficult to govern. For example, his duchies in the Low Countries are largely autonomous, and the Kingdom of Sicily is essentially under the supervision of the Pope.\n\n'Your Majesty...' Who dares to stop the Emperor's carriage? Frederick angrily pulled open the carriage curtain, 'A French envoy seeks an audience with you...'"
DD_SWA_2a: "A vast empire is hesitantly moving forward."
DD_SWA_3_t: "The Destined Emperor"
DD_SWA_3_d: "In the Frankfurt Cathedral, draped with silk curtains, a coronation ceremony is taking place that will link the fates of two duchies. The warm morning light filters through the stained glass windows, transforming into a misty, divine veil that falls upon the red carpet leading to the altar. A young man, the leader of the Hohenstaufen family, steps onto the crimson path of sanctity, walking toward his throne.\n\nThe man receives the orb and scepter from the archbishop who has taught him since childhood, with the crowns of the two duchies displayed beside him. The archbishop anoints his forehead with holy oil and bows deeply to the helmsman of the empire.\n\n'By the grace of God, I shall become the Duke of both Swabia and Bavaria, the protector of the Christian faith, the leader of the Hohenstaufen family and the Holy Roman Empire, the sovereign of the Low Countries, Germany, and Italy.' [Root.Monarch.GetName] scans the crowd in the cathedral, speaking with solemn authority as if his voice were scripture and law, unyielding—'I am, and always will be, the King of the Romans chosen by God, the Emperor of the Empire. No matter what the princes choose, Hohenstaufen shall be the eternal sovereign, the holy emperor. I swear by the omniscient and omnipotent Lord that I will end the division and sin of the empire and unite God's chosen people!'"
