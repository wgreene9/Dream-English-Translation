DD_ELY_1_t: "Perilous Times"
DD_ELY_1_d: "Centuries have passed since the Great Exodus. Our ancestors crossed vast oceans, traveling from the Balkans, Anatolia, and other regions aboard the 'New Ark' fleet. While aiming for Britain, they lost their way and arrived in southern Africa... a land no Greek had ever touched. Initially, the local natives mistook them for a distant merchant convoy—until they saw the sky-obscuring massive fleet and the dark masses of people. Before the natives could report to their king, the fleet's leader, Theodore I Laskaris, launched a sudden attack. This was undoubtedly a rash move, yet this unexpected assault quickly achieved victory. The frontlines advanced all the way to Choma, a wooden fortress soon consumed by Greek fire.\n\nEventually, Theodore the Great negotiated with the local rulers, securing coastal lands for our people and capturing numerous locals to build settlements. The natives soon became the primary labor force replacing the Greeks, gradually integrating into the military as auxiliary troops and large-scale slave soldiers. Over the next century, we encountered old acquaintances—Muslim merchants from Morocco and North Africa—who informed us that our homeland had long fallen under Latin domination and that this was not the New World we had hoped for. Though this land is harsh and unforgiving, it may be the last hope for the Romans.\n\nSince then, attacks from neighboring regions have never ceased, but each time we repelled them with Greek fire. By the time they realized breaching the Roman fortresses was a fantasy, we had established true dominion over this dark continent. However, our reserves of Greek fire are critically low, and this land lacks the necessary raw materials. The day will inevitably come when it runs out, and we must prepare for the worst."

DD_ELY_1a_tt: "Fortunately, other nations fear our §YGreek Fire§! and will §Rtemporarily§! refrain from declaring war on us.\n"
DD_ELY_1a_modifier2: "Population Shortage"
desc_DD_ELY_1a_modifier2: "Due to our practice of endogamy—Greeks marrying only Greeks—our manpower is actually quite limited."

DD_ELY_2_t: "Predicament"
DD_ELY_2_d: "Many years later, John would still recall that day—the desperate day etched forever in his memory...\n\nIt was an ordinary day, no different from any other. John was just an average Greek, merely on patrol along the city walls that day. The sweltering night stirred John's heartstrings; the scorching evening breeze carried him back to the distant homeland he had never seen, boasted of by scholars. They said we do not belong here, that we come from the far-off Roman Empire—a place lush with water and grass, fertile soil, pleasant climate, where even the sea breeze was sweet, nothing like this oppressive heat!\n\nWas the wind picking up? No... that wasn't it... John leaned over the wooden wall to look outside; a shadowy mass was faintly stirring on the open grasslands. Enemy attack! Why today of all days? He had never anticipated this situation, but he knew what he must do now. The captain had to know! John had never seen such a grave expression on the captain's face. Amid the heavy tolling of alarm bells, he gave the order: John was to immediately fetch the Greek fire arsenal to intimidate the enemy.\n\nThough John had never witnessed the power of Greek fire before, he rushed without delay to the armory. At last, he would see the mysterious secret weapon! Greek fire had always been the most classified secret within the Elysian army, rarely deployed. The veterans always boasted about the terrifying, cataclysmic power of that hellish fire—'Whoosh, and it can incinerate everything on the grasslands.'\n\nA creaking sound came from the overburdened, aged plank door. John eagerly turned his gaze to what lay behind—"
DD_ELY_2a: "It was completely empty."
DD_ELY_2a_tt: "§RNow everyone knows.§!\n"
DD_ELY_3_t: "Opportunity"
DD_ELY_3_d: "So the foreigners' mysterious weapon has run out! A raiding party sent earlier this morning has confirmed it. Now let us act—drive these hated enemies into the sea!"
DD_ELY_3a: "Attack!"
DD_ELY_3a_tt: "We can now declare war on @ELY§Y[ELY.GetName]§!.\n"
