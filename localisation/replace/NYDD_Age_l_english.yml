DD_age_1_t:"Endless Winter"
DD_age_1_d:"At first, people thought this winter was merely longer than usual. Snow fell too early in autumn, and rivers froze a full month ahead of schedule. The crops farmers barely harvested were only enough for short-term survival; the grain and gold collected by tax officials fell sharply, and nobles began to cut expenses. People prayed for the bitter cold to end soon, unaware that this was merely the prologue.\n\nPersistent low temperatures caused the soil to freeze deeper, leading to repeated failures in spring planting. Fruit trees ceased to bloom, and livestock died in herds due to lack of forage. Glaciers advanced from the mountains, destroying villages at their foothills. Europe's vineyards soured from reduced sunlight, bringing the wine industry to the brink of collapse; Asia's rice paddies were devastated by summer hailstorms and then faced complete crop failure from autumn drought. Famine began to sweep the continents, forcing people to subsist on tree bark, roots, and even clay.\n\nGrain prices skyrocketed a hundredfold. Hardy crops like potatoes and maize were widely planted, replacing traditional wheat and rice. Meat consumption declined as people turned to fast-growing plants like buckwheat and legumes. The canals of the Netherlands became ice transport networks, with merchant caravans relying on sledges for supplies; China's Jiangnan region recorded the Yangtze River freezing for the first time, forcing people to chop ice for water...\n\nThis winter is still long, and survival is a daunting struggle. Merely staying alive has become a desperate hope."
DD_age_1a:"How much longer will this winter last..."
DD_age_1a_tt:"Activates the sub-era 「§YEndless Winter§!」 for 10 years. All provinces will be affected based on §Yclimate conditions§!, though residents in tropical regions may finally experience a pleasant summer.\n"

DD_mild_winter_more_cold: "Endless Winter - Mild"
desc_DD_mild_winter_more_cold: "It seems this winter will never end. This province has long been gripped by severe cold, leading to serious crop reductions and various other issues, making settlement establishment and development here exceptionally difficult. For the locals, it's merely a heavier snowfall than in previous years."

desc_DD_normal_winter_more_cold: "It seems this winter will never end. This province has long been gripped by severe cold, leading to serious crop reductions and various other issues, making settlement establishment and development here exceptionally difficult.

desc_DD_normal_climate_more_cold: "It seems this winter will never end. This province has long been gripped by severe cold, leading to serious crop reductions and various other issues, making settlement establishment and development here exceptionally difficult. For many, this might be the first time they have ever seen snow."
DD_tropical_more_cold: "Pleasant Climate"
desc_DD_tropical_more_cold: "While most regions are experiencing extreme cold weather, for this tropical province, it might be good news. The drop in temperature has instead made this a place with a pleasant and comfortable climate."

DD_age_2_t: "Endless Summer"
DD_age_2_d: "At first, people thought the first snow of the year had merely come later than last year. But not only winter—this autumn remained unbearably hot. River water levels plummeted, with tributaries of the Rhine and Danube running dry. Temperatures along the Mediterranean coast persistently exceeded 40°C during the summer. Crops withered en masse during the grain-filling stage: European wheat yields fell by 60%, rice in China's Jiangnan region failed to flower due to the heat, and date palm groves across the Arab world died in swathes. Nations waged wars over water allocation; nobles imposed water taxes on peasants; the papacy sold indulgences to the faithful, claiming piety would bring rain; and desert tribes migrated en masse to coastal cities.\n\nPeople sought survival in the extreme heat. Arab merchants introduced drought-resistant pearl millet from East Africa, Chinese farmers experimented with drought-tolerant buckwheat along the Yangtze River basin, and Dutch engineers invented multi-layered underground cisterns to store winter rainwater...\n\nThis summer is still long, and survival is a daunting struggle. Merely staying alive has become a desperate hope."
DD_age_2a: "How much longer will this summer last..."
DD_age_2a_tt: "Activates the sub-era 「§YEndless Summer§!」 for ten years. All provinces will be affected based on §Yclimate conditions§!, though residents in polar regions may finally experience a pleasant winter.\n"
DD_tropical_more_hot: "Endless Summer - Extreme"
desc_DD_tropical_more_hot: "It seems this summer will never end. Extreme heat and scarce rainfall make the already suffering tropics even more tormented. This province has long endured high temperatures and drought, leading to severe crop reductions and various issues, making settlement establishment and development here exceptionally difficult. §RThis is a living hell.§!"
DD_arid_more_hot: "Endless Summer - Normal"
desc_DD_arid_more_hot: "It seems this summer will never end. Extreme heat and scarce rainfall plague this province severely. Persistent high temperatures and drought have caused serious crop reductions and various issues, making settlement establishment and development here exceptionally difficult. People have begun migrating in groups, fleeing to more habitable regions."
DD_normal_climate_more_hot: "Endless Summer - Mild"
desc_DD_normal_climate_more_hot: "It seems this summer will never end. Widespread heat and scarce rainfall severely afflict this province. Prolonged high temperatures and drought have led to serious crop reductions and various issues, making settlement establishment and development here exceptionally difficult. We will endure."
DD_arctic_more_hot: "Glacial Melt"
desc_DD_arctic_more_hot: "As the climate warms, the glaciers here have receded, creating abundant precious water resources. At least compared to other regions suffering under the Endless Summer, it is far more comfortable here."
