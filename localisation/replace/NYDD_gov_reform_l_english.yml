NYDD_ASU_absulute_reform: "Iberian Absolutism"
NYDD_ASU_absulute_reform_desc: "Through the continuous strengthening of centralization and monarchical absolutism, the influence of the great nobles has been weakened, while new nobles and military aristocrats have been elevated. The lands of Iberia are finally fully under our control. Through the political management and economic structure of the feudal system, we have centralized the political power of the entire kingdom, and the monarch of Iberia will wield this supreme authority."

# Sacred Islamic Privy Council
# Although the Mahdi, as the messenger of Allah, has the duty to lead all Islamic brethren, even he cannot manage everything alone. Our Islamic Privy Council was born for this purpose. The council is composed of government administrators, religious scholars, military officers, and local tribal leaders, tasked with assisting the Mahdi's rule by exercising religious, military, and administrative powers.

NYDD_AFR_parliament_reform: "African National Assembly"
NYDD_AFR_parliament_reform_desc: "The predecessor of the African Parliament, the Crusader War Council, once played a pivotal role in this land. The Crusader lords and clergy from various dioceses and major monasteries were undoubtedly the initial components of the parliament. During the era of Mad King Diego, nobles acted independently, corruption replaced indolent nobles in filling the seats, and the military and church gradually took control of the parliament. Now, the chronic ills plaguing our kingdom have been eradicated. The constitution and parliament have restructured the monarchy and government in a rational form, allowing people of different bloodlines and faiths to enter the parliament. The kingdom's parliament can finally truly represent the will of the people, exercising power in the name of unity and the nation."
