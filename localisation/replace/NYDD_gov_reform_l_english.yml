The traditional Salic Law and the Arab invasion have left regional powers independent and divided. Meanwhile, conflicts between the Basques, Catalans, Moors, and coastal and inland regions have led to constant strife. Therefore, we have chosen to adopt a regional autonomy system, granting local autonomy to shift local conflicts between autonomous regions, making them compete rather than oppose the central government.

NYDD_MOR_holy_reform_desc: "While the Mahdi, as Allah's messenger, bears responsibility for leading all Islamic brethren, even he cannot oversee everything alone. Thus our Islamic Privy Council was established. Composed of government administrators, religious scholars, military officers, and tribal leaders, the Council assists the Mahdi's rule by exercising religious, military, and administrative authority."

NYDD_ADU_parliament_reform: "Islamic Council"
NYDD_ADU_parliament_reform_desc: "The Islamic Council nominally leads under the ruler, with the 'Islamic Elder' as its actual leader who typically works alongside the Grand Vizier. Council members primarily consist of muftis, judges of various levels, and Islamic jurists, with subordinate bodies like the 'Assembly of Scholars' and 'Jurisprudence Committee'. As pillars of imperial governance, they oversee judicial rulings, mosque administration, religious ceremonies, welfare endowments, and educational activities. The Council serves as the ruler's Sharia advisor, issues religious rulings, and ensures proper implementation of Islamic law throughout our realm."

NYDD_ADU_BDH_local_reform: "Meritocratic Appointments"
NYDD_ADU_BDH_local_reform_desc: "As our territory expands, the military government's administration has become... let's say 'inadequate' rather than 'perfect'. Our advisors suggest returning to older practices of allowing local officers discretionary governance. While effective, this will undoubtedly leave our troops too occupied with administration to maintain proper training."

NYDD_BRA_fed_parliament_reform: "Imperial Diet and Federal Council"
NYDD_BRA_fed_parliament_reform_desc: "The Federal Council and the Imperial Diet are the governing bodies of the Empire. The Federal Council is composed of representatives from the federal members; each federal member can appoint representatives to the Federal Council based on its voting rights, but all votes from a single state must be cast by only one representative. The Imperial Diet is elected by secret ballot under a proportional system, with each term lasting three years and being unpaid. The Imperial Diet, representing all German people, is responsible for legislation and resolutions on major imperial affairs, while the Federal Council has the power to veto bills proposed by the Imperial Diet and form special committees for specific significant matters."

NYDD_FRA_sunking_reform: "Sun King"
NYDD_FRA_sunking_reform_desc: "French governance philosophy distills to three principles: The unquestioned decision-maker, the nexus of all power, and the divine core of order. France's ruler must be - or convincingly appear to be - this flawless savior. Through absolutist court rule, centralized bureaucracy, and iron-fisted military might, this never-setting Sun King must become the focal point of France and indeed all Europe. Whether this Sun King bears the title of monarch or another designation matters little."

NYDD_BRA_nationist_reform: "National Frontier"
NYDD_BRA_nationist_reform_desc: "Germans, long divided, lacked shared political experiences and a unified national political platform. Thus, they could only rely on cultural elements such as common bloodlines, language, history, and customs—a platform of the 'primordial nation' (Volk)—to overcome the barriers of state separation and construct a German cultural nation.\n\nTherefore, when the wave of nationalism rose in Europe, a sense of cultural community born from Germany's unique culture and ethnic traditions—a cultural movement led by elites like intellectuals and scholars, centered on the ethnic community—took the place of ordinary nationalism. It flourished within the political framework constructed for it by the Kaiser's League.\n\nGerman cultural nationalism disregards the divisions, at least the internationally recognized state borders on the map. It focuses on the German ethnic cultural community, defined by shared bloodlines, history, and culture, viewing the entire German cultural world as a single national whole—a unified national frontier, not merely the borders of the German Empire."
