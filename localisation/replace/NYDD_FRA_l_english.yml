 DD_FRA_2_t: "The Unification War of France"
 DD_FRA_2_d: "The rebellion of the Cathar heresy remains an indelible stain upon the French nation, which sees itself as the heir to the Franks and Charlemagne—a divine retribution from God, with the southern lands destined to burn in the flames of sin. The atrocities of the heretics brought suffering, while the incompetence of the royal court and the disloyalty of southern dukes allowed the imperial court to extend their bloodstained hands into rightful French territories.\n\nNow, imperial intervention has finally bogged down in quagmire. Forces from all sides begin plotting to establish new authority over these blessed fleur-de-lis lands. The Parisian court has proclaimed sovereignty over the south—the chariot of French unification is unstoppable. Meanwhile, southern lords eagerly prepare northern campaigns after independence, amassing their own strength.\n\nRegardless, an unprecedented civil war is inevitable. Who shall claim the supreme glory of unifying France and the crown of fleur-de-lis? The Angevin king holding Paris' wealthy lands, or the ambitious southern dukes full of potential? The French people await with bated breath, while all Christendom watches closely."
 DD_FRA_2a: "God Save France!"

 DD_FRA_3_d: "Our homeland is finally reunified under a mighty king—God's gift, the fleur-de-lis symbolizing light and freedom, bestowed upon [Root.Monarch.GetName], worthy to inherit Charlemagne's name and legacy.\n\nNobles' conspiracies are crushed, rebellious regions pacified, the Hohenstaufen's shameful remnants expelled. Their southern puppet states now belong to us, restored as part of glorious France.\n\nThroughout history, since Frankish times, we have led Europe. After the empire's division, Charlemagne's legacy faded like past great empires. Yet God grants us power to defy decline—we are destined to rule Europe, heal old wounds, and bring freedom and hope.\n\nFrom the Seine's beauty to the Loire's tranquility, France's glory shines equally upon every proud Frenchman. The ancient European hegemon returns, ready to reclaim its glory—from Alpine lands to Pyrenean conflict zones, even Norman-conquered Britain. A new legend begins, eternal."
 DD_FRA_3a: "Vive la France!"
 DD_FRA_4_t: "The Reunification of France"
 DD_FRA_4_d2: "The Occitan people's history is an epic of resistance against foreign aggression. Northern kings claiming divine right to rule us and all France—their centuries of arrogant claims and pathetic efforts to make the south their crown jewel—now dissolve into oblivion.\n\nSince Rome conquered Gaul, Occitans have fought for independence. Through dark ages—Visigoths, Franks, Arabs, Germans—their fleeting hegemonies vanished. The Occitan nation endures like an ageless tree, defying Europe's decline.\n\nNow we conquer our nominal overlords, march to Paris' riverside, and bring a strong new kingdom to freedom-seeking peoples. A new era dawns—Occitania, blessed by God's glory, shall lead France to greater futures."
 DD_FRA_4_d: "The Occitan people's history is an epic of resistance against foreign aggression. Northern kings claiming divine right to rule us and all France—their centuries of arrogant claims and pathetic efforts to make the south their crown jewel—now dissolve into oblivion.\n\nThe Hohenstaufen Emperor, undisputed European lord, liberated us from northern tyrants, declaring only the south may rule France and inherit Gaul's governance from Caesar and Augustus.\n\nNow under imperial leadership, we conquer our nominal overlords, march to Paris' riverside, and bring a strong new kingdom to freedom-seeking peoples. A new era dawns—Occitania, blessed by God's glory, shall bring France a brighter tomorrow under the Holy Roman Empire."
 DD_FRA_4a: "The fleur-de-lis on the throne remains, blooming prouder under southern strength."
 DD_FRA_5_t: "The Crown of Lothair"
 DD_FRA_5_d: "The Duchy of Lorraine—core of the Frankish Empire, lands of Lotharingia—faces fierce competition for its ducal title. Despite shifting ownership during Henry IV's chaotic reign, the Duke of Lorraine remained an undisputed Imperial Diet member.\n\nYet Lothair's bloodline extends beyond the empire. The House of Metz, Angevin vassals of the French king, inherited Lorraine's dukedom. The Emperor cannot tolerate Lothair's legacy leaving the empire, nor will France bow again. The Papacy mediated—the Treaty of Verdun affirmed Lorraine's status as French vassals, but France renounced claims to southern territories.\n\nWith the old duke's death, France's centralization drags vassals onto Paris' war chariot. The wavering new duke hesitates to surrender his crown, seeking imperial allegiance. Imperial troops mass at Lorraine's borders—Lothair's crown beckons bloodshed again. Storm clouds gather over empire and kingdom."

 DD_FRA_7a: "Prepare for battle!"
 DD_FRA_8_t: "Ultimatum"
 DD_FRA_8_d: "The despicable Duke of Lorraine betrayed us for the Empire. These oathbreakers deny feudal contracts, declaring the Emperor their rightful liege. The sacred Treaty of Verdun is torn—no moral barriers remain between us and these mountain-dwelling foes. Our enraged armies stand ready, as do theirs."
 DD_FRA_8a: "This is unacceptable—mobilize the borders!"

 DD_FRA_9_t: "Betrayal of Trust"
 DD_FRA_9_d: "A humiliating farce—the fickle Duke of Lorraine reneged on imperial pleas, kneeling again to France. Imperial troops look like court jesters, awkwardly stationed at borders. This insults imperial authority and desecrates the Treaty of Verdun. Our dignity toys with by the French—frontline forces are paralyzed."
 DD_FRA_9a: "Bloody hell! March onward to the Meuse!"
 DD_FRA_9b: "Let's just withdraw..."
 DD_FRA_10_t: "The Point of No Return"
 DD_FRA_10_d: "Though Lorraine chose France, imperial troops occupy it. The Emperor arrogantly demands France withdraw, claiming Lorraine as imperial territory. Furious nobles demand we teach these invaders a lesson."
 DD_FRA_10a: "Then war it is!"
 DD_FRA_10b: "Lorraine isn't worth the bloodshed..."
 DD_FRA_11_t: "No Alternative"
 DD_FRA_11_d: "French troops enter Lorraine, clashing with imperial forces. Paris invokes the Treaty of Verdun, demanding imperial withdrawal. Imperial princes can no longer tolerate French arrogance—they demand war to reclaim rightful lands."
 DD_FRA_11a: "You leave me no choice."
 DD_FRA_11b: "Better to withdraw."

 DD_FRA_unite_desc: "After centuries, we've liberated French lands from the Empire. France is whole again!"
 #Drawing inspiration from Shakespeare's plot, let's not say it's just from watching comedies.

 #The story involves Richard, the illegitimate son of the King's Governor of England, and Louis of France, along with his wife Elizabeth and her brother Malcolm. Originally, Louis was the legitimate heir. While suppressing the British rebels, he encounters Richard and is astonished to find that the two look almost like twins. (This could include a scene where bystanders mistake one for the other.) They then confront their father, only to discover the truth about Richard's illegitimate status. Fearing that his father might change his favor (since Richard is more courageous and intelligent compared to Louis, who is just an ordinary, even somewhat incompetent heir), Louis poisons and assassinates his father at night. Louis then ascends to the throne, declaring Richard the murderer and imprisoning him in the dungeon. Later, Malcolm, who has just arrived to stage a coup, confronts Louis. (The outcome depends on the situation.) Louis dies. Richard then ambushes and kills his uncle (they could also end up killing each other, in which case Elizabeth ascends to the throne). The survivor then takes the throne.
