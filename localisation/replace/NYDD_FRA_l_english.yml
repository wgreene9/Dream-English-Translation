 DD_FRA_2_t: "The Unification War of France"
 DD_FRA_2_d: "The rebellion of the Cathar heresy remains an indelible stain upon the French nation, which sees itself as the heir to the Franks and Charlemagne—a divine retribution from God, with the southern lands destined to burn in the flames of sin. The atrocities of the heretics brought suffering, while the incompetence of the royal court and the disloyalty of southern dukes allowed the imperial court to extend their bloodstained hands into rightful French territories.\n\nNow, imperial intervention has finally bogged down in quagmire. Forces from all sides begin plotting to establish new authority over these blessed fleur-de-lis lands. The Parisian court has proclaimed sovereignty over the south—the chariot of French unification is unstoppable. Meanwhile, southern lords eagerly prepare northern campaigns after independence, amassing their own strength.\n\nRegardless, an unprecedented civil war is inevitable. Who shall claim the supreme glory of unifying France and the crown of fleur-de-lis? The Angevin king holding Paris' wealthy lands, or the ambitious southern dukes full of potential? The French people await with bated breath, while all Christendom watches closely."
 DD_FRA_2a: "God Save France!"
 DD_FRA_2a_tt: "Unlocks the '§YUnification War of France§!' Casus Belli, allowing annexation of French provinces with §Greduced§! war score cost and aggressive expansion.\nOccupying §YFrench§! region provinces with this CB grants §Gterritorial cores§!."

 DD_FRA_2b_tt2:"At least §Y2§! countries must agree to begin §Ynegotiations§!.\n"
 DD_FRA_3_t: "The Reunification of France"
 DD_FRA_3_d: "Our homeland is finally reunified under a mighty king—God's gift, the fleur-de-lis symbolizing light and freedom, bestowed upon [Root.Monarch.GetName], worthy to inherit Charlemagne's name and legacy.\n\nNobles' conspiracies are crushed, rebellious regions pacified, the Hohenstaufen's shameful remnants expelled. Their southern puppet states now belong to us, restored as part of glorious France.\n\nThroughout history, since Frankish times, we have led Europe. After the empire's division, Charlemagne's legacy faded like past great empires. Yet God grants us power to defy decline—we are destined to rule Europe, heal old wounds, and bring freedom and hope.\n\nFrom the Seine's beauty to the Loire's tranquility, France's glory shines equally upon every proud Frenchman. The ancient European hegemon returns, ready to reclaim its glory—from Alpine lands to Pyrenean conflict zones, even Norman-conquered Britain. A new legend begins, eternal."
 DD_FRA_3a: "Vive la France!"
 DD_FRA_3a_tt:"The event '§YTaxation for France§!' will no longer trigger.\n"
 DD_FRA_4_t: "The Reunification of France"
 DD_FRA_4_d2: "The Occitan people's history is an epic of resistance against foreign aggression. Northern kings claiming divine right to rule us and all France—their centuries of arrogant claims and pathetic efforts to make the south their crown jewel—now dissolve into oblivion.\n\nSince Rome conquered Gaul, Occitans have fought for independence. Through dark ages—Visigoths, Franks, Arabs, Germans—their fleeting hegemonies vanished. The Occitan nation endures like an ageless tree, defying Europe's decline.\n\nNow we conquer our nominal overlords, march to Paris' riverside, and bring a strong new kingdom to freedom-seeking peoples. A new era dawns—Occitania, blessed by God's glory, shall lead France to greater futures."
 DD_FRA_4_d: "The Occitan people's history is an epic of resistance against foreign aggression. Northern kings claiming divine right to rule us and all France—their centuries of arrogant claims and pathetic efforts to make the south their crown jewel—now dissolve into oblivion.\n\nThe Hohenstaufen Emperor, undisputed European lord, liberated us from northern tyrants, declaring only the south may rule France and inherit Gaul's governance from Caesar and Augustus.\n\nNow under imperial leadership, we conquer our nominal overlords, march to Paris' riverside, and bring a strong new kingdom to freedom-seeking peoples. A new era dawns—Occitania, blessed by God's glory, shall bring France a brighter tomorrow under the Holy Roman Empire."
 DD_FRA_4a: "The fleur-de-lis on the throne remains, blooming prouder under southern strength."
 DD_FRA_5_t: "The Crown of Lothair"
 DD_FRA_5_d: "The Duchy of Lorraine—core of the Frankish Empire, lands of Lotharingia—faces fierce competition for its ducal title. Despite shifting ownership during Henry IV's chaotic reign, the Duke of Lorraine remained an undisputed Imperial Diet member.\n\nYet Lothair's bloodline extends beyond the empire. The House of Metz, Angevin vassals of the French king, inherited Lorraine's dukedom. The Emperor cannot tolerate Lothair's legacy leaving the empire, nor will France bow again. The Papacy mediated—the Treaty of Verdun affirmed Lorraine's status as French vassals, but France renounced claims to southern territories.\n\nWith the old duke's death, France's centralization drags vassals onto Paris' war chariot. The wavering new duke hesitates to surrender his crown, seeking imperial allegiance. Imperial troops mass at Lorraine's borders—Lothair's crown beckons bloodshed again. Storm clouds gather over empire and kingdom."
 DD_FRA_5a: "We won't bow to Paris—contact the Emperor!"
 DD_FRA_5b: "France is our destiny..."

 DD_FRA_7a: "Prepare for battle!"
 DD_FRA_8_t: "Ultimatum"
 DD_FRA_8_d: "The despicable Duke of Lorraine betrayed us for the Empire. These oathbreakers deny feudal contracts, declaring the Emperor their rightful liege. The sacred Treaty of Verdun is torn—no moral barriers remain between us and these mountain-dwelling foes. Our enraged armies stand ready, as do theirs."

 DD_FRA_9_t: "Betrayal of Trust"
 DD_FRA_9_d: "A humiliating farce—the fickle Duke of Lorraine reneged on imperial pleas, kneeling again to France. Imperial troops look like court jesters, awkwardly stationed at borders. This insults imperial authority and desecrates the Treaty of Verdun. Our dignity toys with by the French—frontline forces are paralyzed."
 DD_FRA_9a: "Bloody hell! March onward to the Meuse!"
 DD_FRA_9b: "Let's just withdraw..."
 DD_FRA_10_t: "The Point of No Return"
 DD_FRA_10_d: "Though Lorraine chose France, imperial troops occupy it. The Emperor arrogantly demands France withdraw, claiming Lorraine as imperial territory. Furious nobles demand we teach these invaders a lesson."
 DD_FRA_10a: "Then war it is!"
 DD_FRA_10b: "Lorraine isn't worth the bloodshed..."
 DD_FRA_11_t: "No Alternative"
 DD_FRA_11_d: "French troops enter Lorraine, clashing with imperial forces. Paris invokes the Treaty of Verdun, demanding imperial withdrawal. Imperial princes can no longer tolerate French arrogance—they demand war to reclaim rightful lands."
 DD_FRA_11a: "You leave me no choice."
 DD_FRA_11b: "Better to withdraw."
 DD_FRA_12_t:"The Legacy of Champagne"
 DD_FRA_12_d:"The Count of Champagne is advanced in years and has left no legitimate heir. His title originates from the ancient Frankish Empire, with lands adjacent to Île-de-France, making him one of the most important and powerful nobles in the kingdom. Our queen Elizabeth is the old count's only daughter. Should we press her claim to the County of Champagne, or seek a suitable new count for the region?"
 DD_FRA_12_d2:"A farce requires a dutiful actor, a puppet dancing on strings - and Elizabeth is clearly no skilled dancer. She secretly dispatched numerous letters attempting to form an alliance against the Restoration Society to reclaim her royal authority. Unfortunately for her, the Society had specialists monitoring and censoring her correspondence. When the Lord Protector confronted her with a smiling inquiry, she immediately claimed to be the victim of a conspiracy and proposed transferring both the administrative control and revenues of her Champagne territories to the Restoration Society, to aid the grand cause of France's rebirth."
 DD_FRA_12a:"Assume control of Champagne."
 DD_FRA_12b:"Maintain the status quo."
 DD_FRA_12c:"Satisfactory."

 DD_FRA_13_t:"The Public Weal Alliance"
 DD_FRA_13_d:"Recent events in France have forced us to remain vigilant. The new King of France will likely attempt to strip the nobility of their privileges. To prepare, we should consult with other nobles on how to counter Paris' centralization of power."
 DD_FRA_13a:"It would be best to form a Public Weal Alliance against Paris."
 DD_FRA_13b:"We cannot shoulder such responsibility."
 DD_FRA_13a_tt:"Use §YDiplomatic Influence§!'s '§YInvite to Public Weal Alliance§!' to form a coalition against @FRA§YFrance§!.\n"

 DD_FRA_14_t:"Undercurrents"
 DD_FRA_14_d:"Our informants in the duchies report that the nobility is growing restless, forming an alliance against France. Clearly, other nobles don't intend to sit idly by. They know full well what [Root.Monarch.GetName] wants to do—and what they will do. Time is running short; we must identify their ringleader and put them in their place."
 DD_FRA_14a:"Of all possibilities, the Capet in Picardy is the most suspicious..."
 DD_FRA_14b:"Poitou has always been troublesome..."
 DD_FRA_14c:"Could it be Elizabeth's doing..."
 DD_FRA_14d:"The petty Count of Berry, perhaps..."
 DD_FRA_14e:"The likeliest is often the unlikeliest—Nevers, it must be you..."
 #Hah, and then I realized Nevers isn't even a fiefdom.

 DD_FRA_15_t:"True Colors Revealed"
 DD_FRA_15_d:"As the saying goes, secrets cannot withstand scrutiny. With just a casual investigation, the vermin of the Public Weal Alliance have shown their true colors. With the evidence we've gathered, we can now declare them traitors and strip their titles. We await only your command, Your Majesty."

DD_FRA_17_t:"The Oath of the Golden Fleece"
DD_FRA_17_d:"The Albigensian Crusade may have been France's doom, but it is Occitania's opportunity. The imperial invasion plunged France into terrible chaos, yet also revealed another chance for freedom and ambition—a way to cast off the throne's control. While the Emperor busies himself with imperial intrigues, the rival lords of the southern realms may expand their influence. But as the Empire withdraws from Occitania, Paris will surely bare its fangs against the traitors of the southern lands. We cannot wait idly—we must form a united league of Occitan dukes. [Root.GetName] has taken the lead, establishing the Oath of the Golden Fleece, symbolized by the mythical dragon-guarded fleece, binding its members to mutual defense against Parisian aggression."
DD_FRA_17a:"We alone can protect ourselves!"

DD_FRA_18b:"No, we'll face Paris alone."

DD_FRA_19_t:"The King's Speech"
DD_FRA_19_d:"'Gentlemen, I am pleased to gather with you today. Since the shameful and wicked Albigensian War, the doors of the Estates-General have been closed to us for centuries, as has Europe's stage of international politics. In these dark years, France has been dismembered, expelled, and humiliated. They said the homeless Gauls would rot like stray dogs in their graves.\n\nBut gentlemen, we have not. We did not yield to imperial threats, nor content ourselves with bread from the mud. For centuries we have never forgotten - our mother France's flesh remains torn from us, a great wall still divides us from our countrymen. How can one people, one kingdom, endure living in division and disgrace?\n\nToday I stand before you, begging your support for our cause and our homeland. We stand in Paris gazing at our sundered southern lands. Yesterday they divided us with betrayal and humiliation - today we shall reclaim what belongs to France with honor and blood! Support our mother France - we fight not for slavery, not for conquest, but for justice and honor—'"

DD_FRA_199_d:"'Remember this day - today when the doors of the Estates-General reopen to France's children, just as the path to Europe's thrones reveals itself to France once more. Centuries ago, the Empire's lackeys broke France's spine - they burned our fields, ravaged our lands, slaughtered our countrymen, and violated our women. On the plains of Poitou, our ancestors gave their blood and souls to be buried with their homeland.\n\nToday, we too shall embark on this sacred path - a road of wrath and spiritual vengeance. A holy war awaits us! Let all oppression and debate cease as we march the sacred road to reclaim our lands! Drive the vicious invaders from our soil! Everywhere we see only the poverty, hunger, and grief they brought - carpenters endlessly hammering coffins. We who were once proud heirs of Charlemagne now lie slaughtered like stray dogs!\n\nThose southern traitors of old now lounge arrogantly upon their golden mountains of sin - wealth bought with the flesh and blood of France, their mother who nourished them! What reason, what excuse have we not to avenge France's suffering and injustice? So long as our hearts still beat, so long as our nation's spine remains unbroken, our overflowing wrath - our eternally burning heart of fury - shall forever burn for vengeance! Support me, gentlemen! Support our motherland! Let traitors, criminals, and the shameless taste France's fury! Let Europe burn as France burned a century ago!'"

DD_FRA_20_t:"The Treaty of Paris"
DD_FRA_20_d:"France is a splendid and beautiful flower, but beneath her intoxicating fragrance and tender buds swirls a maelstrom of chaos and greed. Richard III's father left him no prosperous kingdom - this English-raised king inherited a realm consumed by war and disorder. His father Richard II, having just received the fractured half-France of the Capetian legacy from his grandfather Edward III, immediately faced the scheming nobility of Paris.\n\nThat bloody succession war shattered the House of Anjou's efforts to restore the kingdom. The hastily signed Treaty of Paris left the crown powerless against noble influence - now the Angevins are merely first among nobles, not divinely-ordained Kings of France. To placate the aristocracy, the widowed Richard III was forced to marry Elizabeth of Valois, uniting both houses in a political alliance against the nobility. Now, as Richard III suffers failing health, his sole heir - motherless and undisciplined - has become a dissolute, weak-willed wastrel. France's future lies shrouded in mist..."
DD_FRA_20a:"Our nation lacks the strength for further wars..."

DD_FRA_21_t:"The Aftermath of Magna Carta"
DD_FRA_21_d:"The bitter fruits of the Albigensian defeat forced Henry III to compromise with England's rebels, signing the Magna Carta that granted autonomy to French-controlled England. Yet these remnants of the English era remain unsatisfied. Sensing France's current weakness with an ailing king, the English have sparked a new rebellion.\n\nThe Dauphin Charles was commanded to lead troops to suppress the English revolt. On the British battlefield, a sword-wielding English soldier caught Charles' attention - this handsome young man bore uncanny resemblance to himself, fighting valiantly like a true knight. Charles brought this youth named Henry back to Paris, hoping his father might provide answers."
DD_FRA_21a:"Oh... I suppose France now has a second option?"

DD_FRA_22_t:"The Princes"
DD_FRA_22_d:"Richard III stared in astonishment at the two strikingly similar young men before the throne. Leaning forward, his gaze fixed upon the glimmering silver cross hanging from the younger man's neck - a gift he had bestowed upon a beautiful maiden years ago. Like a ray of dawn, the sight pierced his illness-ridden heart, stirring memories of his youthful romance in England.\n\n'Henry... my son,' the king murmured as he slumped back onto the throne. He studied this handsome bastard son before him, seeing reflected the flawless English maiden of years past. Like a prisoner chained to his royal seat, he silently contemplated both princes for a long moment before finally waving his hand weakly, signaling the guards to escort them out. He sighed - sighed for his own fate and France's. Flowers bloom but briefly, and destiny waits for no man; neither he nor his kingdom could master their own fates."
DD_FRA_22a:"None noticed how the Dauphin's expression remained hidden in the throne room's shadows."

DD_FRA_23_t:"The Secret Rendezvous"
DD_FRA_23_d:"The king's brother Malcolm clasped the woman's slender waist, fastening a crimson rose in her hair. The woman in his arms - Queen Elizabeth - giggled as her alabaster arms coiled around his neck, her lips brushing his ear in whispered secrets. 'Who would have thought... my brother had another child...' Malcolm gazed absently at the gardens beyond the pavilion.\n\n'Yes, Malco, our opportunity has come,' Elizabeth melted into the man's embrace, resting her head against his chest. 'That boy won't be able to restrain himself - this is more than he can swallow. He knows that Englishman is worth a hundred of him, that he's not the one who should be king.' 'Will he?' 'Oh he will...' Elizabeth lifted her face in his arms, cradling his cheeks before softly biting his lower lip."
DD_FRA_23a:"'He most certainly will.'"

DD_FRA_24_t:"Night"
DD_FRA_24_d:"Dauphin Charles crept silently into the king's bedchamber, where the ruler of France lay sleeping. Clutching a silver ewer of poisoned wine, Charles approached his father's bedside. Pale moonlight seeped through the curtains, weaving a ghostly veil. The time had come - Charles stared resolutely at the slumbering king, steeling his resolve.\n\nSin! Vile, agonizing sin! Yet I shall bear no guilt for this - my foolish, shortsighted father will pay for his mistakes. The Dauphin tilted the ewer, pouring the poison into the king's ear. 'Farewell, father,' he whispered with a dark smile. 'Guards! Guards! The king is dead - betrayed by that English villain! Seize him and cast him into the dungeons!'\n\nA servant who arrived with the guards recoiled at the ghastly sight. Noticing the Dauphin's damp right sleeve, he locked eyes with the prince by candlelight before quickly bowing his head and retreating. Such terrible fate! Such black conspiracy! France will descend into hellfire over this... He must warn the queen at once, no matter the cost!"
DD_FRA_24a:"This cannot be allowed to stand..."

DD_FRA_25_t:"The Duel"
DD_FRA_25_d:"Pale moonlight streamed through the narrow barred window into the icy dungeon. Louis raised his bound hands as the creaking iron door revealed a towering figure emerging from the flickering candlelight, gripping a long steel sword. 'Good evening, dear brother,' the visitor chuckled darkly before him. 'This is the last time you'll cheat Death from Fate's grasp. Submit to your destiny, Henry.'\n\n'With this single stroke,' the Dauphin raised his blade high above the condemned man, 'the tragic fate binding us both shall end!' Henry, refusing to yield, struggled to free himself and draw the dagger hidden at his waist—until another unexpected guest disrupted his brother's plans. 'Your schemes end here, Charles,' declared Malcolm in full armor, drawing his sword as he surveyed the two princes. 'Sinners shall pay for their crimes—both of you!'\n\n'Den of vipers...' Henry hissed, dagger in hand as he coiled low like a serpent eyeing his foes. All three claimants knew: the crown of France would demand blood as its price."

DD_FRA_25a:"Charles' blade successfully shattered the throne's challengers."
DD_FRA_25b:"Prince Henry fought his way through the ambush."
DD_FRA_25c:"Malcolm thwarted the conspiracy and claimed his prize."

DD_FRA_25d_tt:"§RFrance's fate continues drowning in blood and chaos.§!\n"

DD_FRA_26_t:"The Crown of Iniquity"
DD_FRA_26_d:"As dawn's first light pierced Paris, France's victor emerged from the kin-slaying struggle. The new king slumped against the dungeon's cold stones, breathing laboriously. The damp, fetid air scraped down his raw throat into exhausted lungs, laced with the searing tang of blood that set his windpipe aflame.\n\nBracing against his scabbard, Charles shoved the corpse aside and staggered upright. Louis, he thought glancing at his brother's still form on the flagstones, I'll likely forget you by tomorrow. Tearing a rag from another body's cloak, he wiped his gore-caked blade. Henceforth, he was France's king—a kingslayer. He knew it. He no longer cared."
DD_FRA_26a:"A crown of iniquity, yet France's crown nonetheless."

DD_FRA_26_d2:"France's king rose from the bath, toweling his scarred body vigorously. The steaming water cleansed grime but not the clinging metallic stench. That dungeon's chill still haunted him, gnawing at his heart like a persistent specter.\n\nOne month prior, he'd been a common English soldier. Now he sat upon France's throne, crowned over kinsmen's corpses. The draft through his half-shuttered window made Henry shiver in his robe. No time—a fractured kingdom and two embittered nations awaited their king."
DD_FRA_26b:"He must be king, though the crown be forged in blood and treachery."

DD_FRA_26_d3:"Malcolm blinked awake in silken sheets, observing the naked beauty beside him. His wine-fogged mind pieced together last night—ah yes... a delightful tryst, wild passion, and oh—that trifling massacre.\n\nHis queen stirred drowsily, amber eyes glazed as they met his. He chuckled darkly. What dreary thoughts—those whelps weren't worth remembering on such a glorious morning. He crushed Elizabeth's lips beneath his teeth until she gasped for air.\n\nThough truly, more concessions to the nobles were needed to secure his throne... Damned nuisance with dawn barely broken. Annoyed, he thrust his tongue deep into her mouth. Hah... this kingship... perhaps not worth the trouble."
DD_FRA_26c:"Incest, injustice, and cruelty—the foundation of royalty."

DD_FRA_26_d4:"Elizabeth sat helpless upon the throne, staring at her council. That bloody night of schemes had consumed all royal claimants—even Malcolm lay dead—and now she found herself inexplicably crowned amidst the chaos. This was never her design!\n\nThe overwhelmed queen now ruled a realm she scarcely understood, relying entirely on that officer beside her—the very man who'd orchestrated her rise. Noticing her gaze, the soldier-kingmaker tilted his head with a faint smile. 'Worry not, Your Grace,' he murmured, studying France's queen, 'I shall handle everything.'"
DD_FRA_26d:"'I stand ever with France.'"

DD_FRA_27_t:"Night in Paris"
DD_FRA_27_d2:"Astonishing news from Paris spread throughout France, lifting a weight from the hearts of its nobility. The two French princes had slain each other in the dungeons. The king's brother, the Duke of Angoulême Malcolm, now proclaimed himself France's new monarch, promising greater privileges to the aristocracy to better govern the realm. Across France, glasses clinked as all sought to profit from this new arrangement."
DD_FRA_27_d:"Disturbing tidings from Paris rippled across France, sending tremors through the card-house of noble power. Whispers told of a bloody palace struggle culminating in a new prince, [FRA.Monarch.GetName], ascending the throne while former Queen Elizabeth fled to her ancestral Champagne holdings. Unease gripped the land—none knew whether this king would prove France's salvation or ruin, nor how he'd handle the rebellious fiefdoms since the Treaty of Paris. All remained shrouded in uncertainty."
DD_FRA_27_d3:"Shocking reports from Paris set every ambitious heart in France stirring. With both the heir and king's brother dead under mysterious circumstances, the widowed Queen Elizabeth now stood at the forefront—though every noble knew her to be but a puppet of the so-called French Restoration Society's officer cadre. Across the realm, conspiratorial whispers spread as aristocrats prepared their armies to contest the crown."
DD_FRA_27a:"Pray for France."

DD_FRA_28_t:"Brittany's Defiance"

DD_FRA_30_t:"The Twilight Knight"
DD_FRA_30_d:"The de Stray family was a knightly house in gradual decline. Few remembered they once produced a Marshal of France who fought beside kings - Raoul de Stray, the Butcher of Poitou. Though he turned the tide at the bloody Battle of Poitou, he couldn't save the dying kingdom nor his liege. After the Albigensian defeat, the homeless Raoul returned to his ancestral lands, spending his remaining years in torment.\n\nIn Milet de Stray's childhood, his grandfather often recounted tales of this ancestor. In his final days, the former marshal's mind deteriorated until he forgot his own glory. 'How could I be marshal when I couldn't even be a proper soldier?' he'd exclaim. Yet sometimes he'd urgently issue battle commands for Poitou as if still trapped in that hellscape.\n\nTo Milet, his family shared France's fate - stripped of everything. They were knights of the twilight; France had lost half her lands, leaving only shame and hatred. Yet they remained knights, warriors sworn never to die unarmed. Only one path burned in Milet's heart: military service. For this minor French knight, it was the sole road to his nation's salvation."
DD_FRA_30a:"Our glorious crest lies buried in dust, while only fire burns across our land."

DD_FRA_31_t:"The French Restoration Society"
DD_FRA_31_d:"All of Milet's superiors agreed - while Sir de Stray might not have been a proper knight, he was undoubtedly an exceptional soldier. His brilliant military talents overshadowed his cold and ruthless nature, with corpses on the battlefield forming the crimson steps of his ascent. The gifted Major de Stray successfully joined France's Military Privy Council, becoming a royal aide-de-camp.\n\nTo his surprise, Milet discovered many like-minded soldiers within the army. He joined the French Restoration Society - a militant group of patriotic officers thirsting for revenge and war. Inheriting leadership from a retiring general, he transformed this modest club of kindred spirits into a true political force.\n\nAt last, Milet's moment arrived. The weak-willed royals became embroiled in another ugly succession crisis, and with the military maintaining strict neutrality, no strong victor emerged. The Restoration Society swiftly seized the palace and Paris, installing a Valois puppet on the throne. France had finally returned to the path Milet envisioned - the avengers of a bygone era now stood ready to repay their invaders in kind."
DD_FRA_31a:"The wheels of war have begun to turn."

DD_FRA_32_t:"A Man of No Importance"
DD_FRA_32_d:"To be blunt, Milet de Stray was but a down-at-heel knight. True, his lineage once produced an illustrious Marshal of France - but that glory belonged to bygone days, a crest long buried in parched earth. The Strays differed little from other Frenchmen: an unsatisfactory life, a failed nation, and a heart that still beat - Milet de Stray was nobody of consequence.\n\nYet it mattered not. Like millions of his failed generation, Milet yearned to save his country - as Charlemagne once did. In childhood, he'd often slip into the grain mill's tower, surveying his homeland below as if soaring free-winged over open fields.

The path to centralization inevitably brings storms - nobles clutching their privileges won't idly watch themselves become mere fertilizer for the lily. A rebel army determined to defy Paris has assembled, marching toward the garden of the fleur-de-lis, just as they did a century ago.\n\nOnce more, the throne of lilies is shrouded in shadow, and the night that will decide France's fate has come. Will the nobles become mere marionettes of centralized power, or will Paris' throne be reduced to the plaything of aristocrats? France dances eternally amidst the chaos."

Forgive me, Julian - forgive me for not going with you. I am a Rhinelander, born here, raised here, and fated to die by the Rhine. I am a Rhinelander, child, a proud German. I devoted my life to God - at least let this wretched soul remain with my homeland at the end.\n\nFarewell, take care of the children. I'm sorry I lied - I can't check yesterday's lessons anymore. Not today, not tomorrow. In my youth I served the Emperor until an arrow pierced my knee on the battlefield, leaving this useless body to rot in the church. But I was glad to be your teacher, truly. Simple letters couldn't change our nation's defeated fate, but they could plant seeds of hope for tomorrow.\n\nNow, child, I must remove this priest's black robe, take up a sword and face the French. This is my final lesson to you - always, always love your homeland. We are Rhinelanders, Germany's children. You're the eldest and wisest among the church children - I hope you understand. One day even German doves may have to learn French, but remember - we are Germans.\n\nRun, Julian! Take the children across the beautiful Rhine, eastward. Don't stop until you reach another rushing river. Remember always - long live Germany!'\n\n- Father Lukas"

Inside, the air carried the mingled scents of cedarwood and ledger parchment, while his eldest son Eli stumbled through Abelard's 'Historia Calamitatum' by the fireplace - an assignment from their Parisian tutor Leclerc. 'Father, why must we learn the conqueror's tongue?' Eli set down the book, candlelight dancing on his crumpled collar's velvet trim. 'The rabbi says this is shameful betrayal.'\n\nAbraham traced his finger over still-wet ink on the French contract in his ledger, answering his son's question with silence. Three weeks prior, he'd 'purchased' the French garrison commander's private wine stash at half-price - the price being half-share in his Rhineland-Alsace smuggling operations for the commander's mistress. French blades had hacked apart his business, livelihood and nation alike; now his wares needed Alsatian labels to sell, let alone discuss laughable notions like dignity or nationhood.\n\nYet his lips remained sealed as if waxed shut, mouth working mechanically without sound. He understood his son's struggle. Leclerc's teaching bordered on cruel. Each dawn, Eli had to recite in French - half a pastry deducted per mispronounced word.\n\nHe recalled passing the study one night, hearing his son weep in broken French: 'Monsieur, why...no German explanation first?' 'Because shame is the best teacher,' Leclerc had coldly replied. 'Did rioters explain in German when they looted your grandfather's Mainz shop?'\n\nThe silence stretched until Abraham finally spoke, voice strained but firm, meeting Eli's azure eyes: 'To reach higher stations, my son.

The Church's leader had returned to our Heavenly Father's garden, leaving behind only a broken world.\n\nParis' royal court received word first, and like greedy wolves they refused to let this rare opportunity slip. By controlling over a third of the cardinals, France swiftly elected a new pope in Avignon, hoping to seize control of the Church and restore the lily's glory. But Rome's College of Cardinals, particularly the Italian cardinals, denounced them as Satan's hounds daring to steal the holy vestments.\n\nWhite smoke rose astonishingly fast over Rome - this time heralding not dawn and light, but war and sin. Since the 11th century East-West Schism under Michael, Christendom has again plunged into the abyss of strife and betrayal. The Empire, Avignon, and Rome - three popes now denounce each other as antipopes and excommunicate one another.

Crimson dusk bled through stained glass saints, casting fractured light upon the marble floor. An ornate golden crucifix dug sharply into his palm as he clutched it with white-knuckled intensity.\n\n'Heavenly Father - absolve me of my sins,' he whispered. Against the darkening indigo sky, the bloody sun hung low, its fiery light filtering through the chapel windows to bathe the Virgin's pale hands in scarlet, draping the man's bowed head in crimson veils. 'Cleanse my sullied soul, bless me with the glorious sun's eternal radiance and peace...'\n\nHis words grew slower, heavier, dissolving into murmurs as intimate as lovers' whispers. Celestial requiems seemed to echo in his ears, lifting him toward the abyss of heaven. 'Kyrie eleison! Lord have mercy upon me. Have mercy...'\n\n'Monsieur Eli,' came the coarse French voice shattering the sanctity of dusk. The intruder's boots echoed rudely through the nave. 'The envoy from Paris demands your audience.' 'Je comprends,' Eli replied in flawless, aristocratic French, his tone polished yet glacial.

Yet when Julian pulled his dagger from this unfortunate French sentry's heart, it came away with unnatural ease - as if some voice in his soul whispered this was his destiny, the purpose for which he was born and would die.\n\nLike with other victims, Julian tore a strip from the dead man's uniform to wipe stubborn blood from the blade's grooves. He crept toward the embassy parlor door, where fractured French phrases leaked through the keyhole, dancing with the speaker's agitation like a church's broken pipe organ wheezing into the frigid night, drifting toward the ghastly crescent moon.\n\nThe elegant door yielded silently to his touch. 'I said no disturbances—' the Parisian envoy's roar died as Julian's dagger flashed. A crimson fountain arced as the man collapsed like a slaughtered stallion, gurgling wordless screams.\n\nThe German representative opposite sat frozen. His body trembled first, Adam's apple bobbing soundlessly, then slumped back in resignation. With a bitter smile, he removed his spectacles and pocketed them calmly, awaiting the blood-splashed assassin.\n\n'You too were once a German like me.' Boots pounded down the corridor. Julian locked eyes with the man, hurled a fresh dagger into his thigh, and sprang toward the window. As soldiers flooded the room, Julian escaped with a dancer's grace, leaving only moonlit curtains billowing madly in his wake."

Those azure eyes stared vacantly, faintly reflecting fading tear tracks. Bound and silent, the man stood beneath the gallows like a dying butterfly caught in spider's silk.\n\n'You stand condemned for conspiring against the crown, meddling in succession, plotting against royalty, and treason,' declared the priest clutching his black-bound Bible. 'Will you repent, Charles?' With great effort, the man raised his head, the rough noose biting into his neck.

Take your son and begone - never return. Glory, family, bloodline - all ties to this name are severed.'\n\nIllness, wandering, suffering. From that night of exile, Charles and his father knew only rootless misery. Coughing blood once more, the man understood his time was short. 'Charles,' he whispered through pain-curled lips, yet his voice remained calm. 'I'll send you to an old friend. Be dutiful in his care.' 'Father—' 'Charles.' His tone turned firm. His hollow gaze fixed on the muddy puddle before them, where the moon's reflection floated pristine as jade amidst the filth. Yet try as he might, he could no longer discern his own face in those troubled waters.\n\n'Your bloodline, your homeland,' the man murmured, speaking to his son and himself alike, 'never forget your name, child.

The surname he'd abandoned, the heart he'd locked away - this silent boy hung in her world like an unnamed star suspended in empty night.

Charles met those azure eyes briefly before looking away. 'I remain commander of the Royal Guard. They... you understand.' Golden strands cascaded like liquid silk over her shoulders as lowered lashes - delicate as folded fans - veiled the lake-clear gems of her eyes, obscuring all emotion. 'Was it... necessary?' 'I'm sorry, I—'\n\n'I see, Charles.' She raised those prismatic aquamarine eyes, their watery mirrors crinkling into crescent moons as dimples surfaced like rose petals on alabaster skin.

'Then I must go to Paris as well,' Sylvie replied. The restless sea breeze caressed her face, lifting strands of her golden hair like liquid metal.\n\n'Oh dear,' Sylvie reined in her horse with feigned distress. Though wearing a lady's gown, she sat astride like her brother. 'My skirt's caught in the stirrup.' With a sigh, Charles dismounted and deftly lifted the layers of white tulle, revealing slender legs and delicate ankles sheathed in lace-trimmed socks. 'I told you not to ride in a dress...'\n\nUnlike the fluttering fabric beneath her, Sylvie sat motionless, gazing at the moonlit sea. The crescent moon filtered through gauzy clouds, painting a shimmering silver path across the dark waters - a celestial road stretching toward distant azure stars, undulating with each gentle wave.\n\n'Charles,' the girl parted pale rose lips, 'when this is over... go straight to Toulouse.

Torches formed blazing walls in the ink-black night, illuminating the city and encircling her estate. The acrid scent of burning already drifted on the wind with ember sparks - her doom approached.\n\nMoonlight pure as spring water filtered through the chaotic flames, while the Milky Way spanned the vast firmament. The firelight set her golden hair ablaze, dancing wildly in Parisian winds. She'd known this day would come since learning the boy's true name - that she would die for his moonlight. Or become his moonlight. It mattered little now.\n\nSuddenly, a carriage like a war chariot exploded through the manor gates with detonations. As the horseback youth reached down, pulling her up with fate's own grip, she felt her heart constrict with suffocating anguish.\n\nAh—what manner of sickness was this love? Burning cheeks, tangled thoughts, a heart pounding beyond control.

'The lies we tell those closest need no artistry - isn't that what you'd say?'\n\nThe moonlight burned hot, his heart hotter still. Charles pressed the reins into Sylvie's hands, then reached up to stroke her radiant hair, gently removing her hair tie. Those golden tresses cascaded like stardust over her shoulders in the pearlescent glow. 'Keep this as my memento - surely you've not forgotten how to ride, Sylvie!'\n\nBefore she could answer, he leapt onto the carriage roof and severed the traces.

The Crown's powers were strictly limited - no royal veto over laws, no infringement on parliamentary taxation, no standing army without consent, no interference with legislative speech, no arbitrary arrests, and mandatory parliamentary sessions.\n\nThe military escorted a Capetian exile from Rhineland to Paris. Recognizing that French rule now extended beyond ethnic French lands - and that even Frenchmen recoiled at a French-named king - the monarch adopted 'Reinhard', a common German name.

Artillery roared, their iron shot blasting masonry into clouds of dust and debris. Cheers erupted with each impact. When the walls crumbled, desperate defenders raised white flags.

After the religious wars and a series of conflicts caused by faith, the Gallican Church ultimately declared its independence from the Catholic Church, recognizing the King of France as the sacred leader of the church, while the Archbishop of Lyon serves as the Primate and Metropolitan of the entire French national church—that is, the Archbishop of Lyon or the Holy See of Lyon. The church adopts a three-fold holy order, believes in apostolic succession, and maintains most Catholic traditions in practice.

 #Drawing inspiration from Shakespeare's plot, let's not say it's just from watching comedies.

 #The story involves Richard, the illegitimate son of the King's Governor of England, and Louis of France, along with his wife Elizabeth and her brother Malcolm. Originally, Louis was the legitimate heir. While suppressing the British rebels, he encounters Richard and is astonished to find that the two look almost like twins. (This could include a scene where bystanders mistake one for the other.) They then confront their father, only to discover the truth about Richard's illegitimate status. Fearing that his father might change his favor (since Richard is more courageous and intelligent compared to Louis, who is just an ordinary, even somewhat incompetent heir), Louis poisons and assassinates his father at night. Louis then ascends to the throne, declaring Richard the murderer and imprisoning him in the dungeon. Later, Malcolm, who has just arrived to stage a coup, confronts Louis. (The outcome depends on the situation.) Louis dies. Richard then ambushes and kills his uncle (they could also end up killing each other, in which case Elizabeth ascends to the throne). The survivor then takes the throne.
