DD_CMN_1_t: "Thunder on Horseback"
DD_CMN_1_d: "In the Khan's tent, the Great Khan [Root.Monarch.GetName] stared at the tattered parchment map on the table, ambition burning like fire. To the north of the vast steppe lay the reunified Rus' Federation; west of the Slavic lands stood the empire's unbreakable eastern wall. Only beyond the barrier of the Carpathian Mountains lay a golden land full of opportunities for the Cumans.\n\nBehind the Teutonic Knights' heavy shields lay the chaotic and weak Kingdom of Hungary. The foolish Hungarians were still fighting bloody battles over succession rights, even alienating the very Teutonic Knights who alone could block the Cuman cavalry. The Khan held no nostalgia for his former employers; his hand resting on his saber lightly stroked the blade, his knuckles tapping the hilt rhythmically, as if already hearing the thunder of ten thousand hoofbeats from his cavalry."
DD_CMN_1a: "The earth-shaking iron hooves approach like thunder from the hazy horizon."
DD_CMN_1a_tt: "For the first §Y1§! year, no nation except @TEU§Y[TEU.GetName]§! can join this war.\n"

DD_CMN_2_t: "In the Name of Knights"
DD_CMN_2_d: "At first, it was just faintly stirred gravel, then the ground began to rhythmically tremble, drumming on every heart like war drums. Until the raised yellow dust blotted out the sun, and the thunderous roar seemed to shake the very earth itself—no need for the frantic sentries or alarm bells to know: the steppe invasion had arrived. The calamitous cavalry appeared like demons from the horizon dyed crimson by the setting sun, emerging from half-visible battle standards into a clearly visible tide of troops.\n\nThe clanging alarm bells grew increasingly urgent amidst the approaching thunder of hooves, urging people onto the battlements. The Teutonic Order's commander stared with bloodshot eyes, trying to comprehend how these Cumans had appeared here. Cannons on the walls roared incessantly, with burning stones or screaming soldiers constantly falling from the ramparts. The commander pulled his sword from a unfortunate Cuman's ribs, roaring furiously at the knights under the eagle banner—"
