 DD_AFR_1_t: "The Sinful Kingdom Beneath the Tower"
 DD_AFR_1_d: "The Kingdom of Africa was once an eagle soaring over North Africa, a bloodline chosen by the Lady of the Lake, descendants of El Cid. But now, the wings of this kingdom, along with her pride, have been shattered. The long reign of 'Mad King' Diego was like an endless night for this kingdom, with the first half of his life spent in debauchery and neglect of state affairs, and the latter half tormented by madness and hysteria.\n\nThe King of Sin and Madness—that's what people called him. His bloody and dark court was manipulated by jesters and treacherous villains, with power-hungry nobles, countless illegitimate children, and profit-seeking Genoese merchants controlling the country. A kingdom of holy and noble knights, a land of vile and dark corruption, a skeletal steed wreathed in sulfurous flames carrying countless souls towards a crimson pool of blood, while the once-proud bloodline is now bound by the seven sins.\n\nBeneath the capricious Mad King's tower lies a nation plagued by corruption and chaos. The remnants of the Hautevilles guard the kingdom's borders amidst the yellow sand, while restless ambitions bloom on the crimson soil. Under the oppressive rule, the furious waves of Muslim uprisings repeatedly strike the kingdom's foundation. The last great Muslim uprising nearly shattered the pillars of the tower, and the kingdom, controlled by incompetents, is like a lone boat adrift in a stormy sea on a rainy night. The mad king lies delirious on his bed, the demon of the sulfurous lake pulling him deeper into the abyss, and the future of this disordered kingdom is heading towards the unknown. A glorious lineage is heading towards destruction, a sacred kingdom is heading towards its end—the sword-bearer of old will die by that bloodied sword."

 DD_AFR_2_t: "The Dark Current"
 DD_AFR_2_d: "The young man stood crowded among the people by the luxurious bed, gazing at the corpse that could barely be called his father, and the portraits of his valiant ancestors by the bedside. For his age, he might only be considered a boy. But as a bastard, a naive boy could never survive in this court. Dark currents surged, and ink-black clouds blotted out the sun.\n\nAh, the fleeing and wailing people, the crumbling and disintegrating kingdom, the tainted and dishonored bloodline, the dimming and declining faith, the silent and lightless future. He stared blankly at the eagle on the family crest, thinking, let me be the crow, coming from the mad darkness, going into the black night. Beating, the man's heart was beating violently, just like his ancestors standing on the Iberian plateau.\n\nHis gaze passed over the priest in the black robe with golden patterns, over the luxurious and holy cross, and landed on the King of Sins of Africa. The king's face was as terrifying as a skeleton, his sallow and wrinkled skin tightly clinging to his bones, his hollow eye sockets seemingly empty, filled only with boundless darkness. Everyone knew that the storm of Africa was coming, the great net of calamity was enveloping everyone, and the mad dark currents surged endlessly.\n\nThe deep bells of the church echoed in the dim palace, startling flocks of crows flying past the windows. Let me once again give wings to this kingdom in the dust, the boy thought, gazing at the blood-stained sunset, yearning for a sky that belonged to this kingdom, to the Christians—to him."

 DD_AFR_33_d: "For the Muslims of Africa, the reign of Rodrigo III the Cold-Blooded a century ago was the opening of the gates of hell. In the muddy ground, the heads of the faithful rolled; in the kingdom's treasury, the wealth carved from the blood of Muslims glittered. Rodrigo III's iron-fisted policies have continued to this day, but unfortunately, the prosperity and order under his rule have not. The Muslim warriors have never given up hope of resistance, just as they have never doubted that one day the crescent moon will reappear in the night sky. The waves of Moorish resistance against the kingdom have grown stronger and stronger.\n\nNow, the kingdom on the tower is on the verge of collapse, and the Muslims in the desert have finally seen the beacon of resistance once more. The Moroccan Islamic Corps, which gained independence during the first great uprising, was the first to light the beacon, and the loyal governor of Fez stands on the front line of this towering wave. Blood, shame, faith. The blood rain carved by hatred engulfs the sinful kingdom, and the Second Great Muslim Uprising has begun. For the Kingdom of Africa in the storm, this is only the beginning."

Sadly, we are also caught in the eye of the storm, unable to escape the grasp of fate. The governor of Fez is still struggling to hold on, while an even fiercer storm gathers on the horizon."

The Muslims of Tlemcen emerged from the sands of the Sahara, striking our governor's territory in Algiers like lightning, catching the governor off guard. The Moors, like ghosts in the desert, appear and disappear, leaving us exhausted.\n\nEverywhere, there are Berber armies like locusts, everywhere there are brutal and bloodthirsty Muslim bandits. The terrifying effects of the Second Great Muslim Uprising are now truly showing on our land, but we can only let fate take its course, drifting in the waves of disaster."

The commander of the Cyrenaica Legion silently gazed at the overcast sky, watching the military flags dancing wildly in the wind and rain.\n\n\"Sound the horn,\" he said softly, as if talking to himself, then suddenly roared again, \"Sound the horn!\" The last commander of the Hautevilles drew his silver-white sword and pointed it towards the west, where the dark clouds gathered.

The Muslim blades are already raised above our heads, the Christian kingdom is in peril, and souls yearning for salvation now yearn even more for survival.\n\nNow, the Kingdom of Africa urgently needs the support of the Crusaders, the support of the Holy See to launch a holy war, to save this troubled kingdom.

Looking back, the Lake Knight who once landed in North Africa and shattered the Almohads has also become a phantom of the past, and his great kingdom is step by step heading towards the abyss.\n\nThe Muslim threat looms over us like a nightmare, while our past glory can no longer be preserved.

We can only watch all this happen, powerless to do anything.\n\nThe faithful of Christ are slaughtered like lambs, the once impregnable walls have crumbled like dust, the invincible armies have shattered like glass, and the kingdom on the sand is slipping away like sand. We have gone astray like sheep, each turning to his own way."

His snow-white suit was covered in bright red stains, a long sword in his hand, the blade dripping with blood that stained the expensive Arabian carpet. \"Your Majesty, you are ill,\" the man said, looking at the king by the window, gazing into the distance, his incompetent elder brother, then placed his hand on his chest and bowed. \"Please come with us, this is the will of the Archbishop and the Marshal.\"\n\nThe Mad King's eldest son simply stared calmly out the window, watching the torrential rain wash over the gray world outside the palace. \"The jackals coveting the throne will be hanged, the madmen lusting for power will only burn in hell, I am the King of Africa! I...\" The angry words caught in his trembling throat, and all that came out was warm blood. The king looked down in shock at his chest, only to see a slender silver sword that had pierced his noble chest from behind.\n\nThe man crowned as Regent kicked the king out of the window, and the bloated, luxurious body crashed through the palace window, landing heavily in the muddy garden. The relentless rain pierced the king's brocade robe like arrows, spreading the crimson pool beneath him into the dark rainy night."

 DD_AFR_12_t: "The White Crow"
 DD_AFR_12_d: "In the boy's unwelcome childhood, he was often called a crow in the royal family because of his jet-black hair, gloomy personality, and his mother's lowly birth. Darkness, vileness, the survival of the fittest—life in the court was just like this decaying, disordered kingdom. An innocent child could never remain untouched in the whirlpool of power and conspiracy.\n\nThe boy, scornfully called a crow, was clearly no stranger to conspiracy. Decades of climbing over dead bodies, murder, framing, political strife. He climbed step by step from the stinking pile of corpses, even climbing to the center of the kingdom's power as a member of the royal family, of course, stepping over the corpses of his blood brothers. The young governor of the kingdom looked at these high-ranking officials he once admired, at the incompetent rulers and profiteers, who were no nobler than the lower classes they despised. Fire, a raging fire, burned the governor's fiery ambition.\n\nAnd so he made his choice. On the steps to the throne, the crimson blood dripped from the blade of the new king in white. Flocks of crows flew around the dome of the palace, cutting across the blood-red sky. He looked up at this war-torn country. The Christian kingdom is burning, the people of Africa are weeping. Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, the white crow who would save this country and reclaim this sky, is stepping towards his throne."

Why must I be the one to save this country?\n\nYes. Why did I choose to walk into the heart of this disaster? Was it for power and fame? For wealth and glory? To prove myself to those who looked down on me? I can't remember anymore. This lonely path bound by crimson flames has stretched too far. Even though I have ended the flames of rebellion, saved the kingdom's cause, and stood at the end of the road, I cannot find my future.\n\nIt's not over yet.

Fragrant petals dredge memories of crawling through sin, coalescing into a melancholic, violent river.\n\nBut methods are mere tools; creeds cannot shake his adamant heart.
