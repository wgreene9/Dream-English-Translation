While pursuing profit may be human nature, did the Duke of Zhou labor tirelessly and Zhuge Liang devote himself completely merely for profit? Did Confucius travel between states and Qu Yuan drown himself in the Miluo River for worldly gain?\nWhen the Connected Paths first raised righteous troops, it was out of compassion for the suffering masses, gathering heroes to restore peace - how dare we seek private profit?\nExpelling tyrants, pacifying barbarians, and uniting the realm - all deeds of the Connected Paths stem from concern for the people's hardships. Protecting borders and comforting the people remain our paramount duties. Only through diligence and frugality can we achieve Great Order Under Heaven.\n"

NYAB_MIN_1_t: "Unrest in Quanzhou"
NYAB_MIN_1_d: "Quanzhou, rightfully hailed as the greatest eastern port, gathers travelers from all directions. The merchants who visit come not just from East Asia, but from as far as Persia and Arabia. Trade fleets cross vast oceans to reach Quanzhou, seeking rare commodities while bringing with them diverse religions, ideologies, and cultures that converge upon this land.\n\nThe Yuan dynasty imposed numerous self-created social classes across China - notably the Semu people. Most were captives brought from Central Asia and Persia. Many coveted Quanzhou's prosperity and came to the Eight Min region seeking opportunity. Colluding with the Yuan regime, they caused significant disturbances. Only after the righteous army captured Quanzhou and dealt with the most troublesome Semu families did their influence wane. But recently we've received reports of their renewed activity, apparently supported by some secretive family."
NYAB_MIN_1a: "What trouble could these foreigners possibly cause? Let them be."
NYAB_MIN_1a_modifier: "Quanzhou Unrest"
NYAB_MIN_1b: "Increase patrols and surveillance."

NYAB_MIN_2_t: "The Chronicle of Xiao Su"
NYAB_MIN_2_d: "Xiao Su, courtesy name Mingzhi, was born in Quanzhou. His ancestors had relocated there during Fang Guozhen's rebellion, establishing their family in the port city.\n\nHis father, a shrewd merchant of remarkable business acumen, expanded their modest family assets into one of Quanzhou's most renowned commercial houses. Though not scholarly himself, the elder Xiao revered learning and spared no expense in hiring eminent scholars to tutor young Mingzhi.\n\nFrom childhood, Mingzhi showed exceptional promise. Studying maps of the fractured Central Plains, he burned with ambition to both wield the brush and ride to war, restoring order through civil and military arts. When townsfolk marveled, asking 'Will our young master astonish the world?', Mingzhi would solemnly reply: 'One day I shall ride the wind.'\n\nYet destiny proved fickle. Despite his grand aspirations, Mingzhi found no outlet for his talents. Mastering rites and arts brought no opportunity, so he accompanied his father on trade journeys, studying regional customs across Jianghuai, Haidai, Lingnan, and even Goryeo, Ryukyu, Jiaozhi, Japan and the Nanyang kingdoms - all meticulously recorded. When his father fell gravely ill, Mingzhi assumed control of the family business, demonstrating such commercial genius that the clan willingly transferred full authority to him. Yet with growing responsibilities, his youthful ambitions seemed ever more distant.\n\nSoon Mingzhi's fame spread throughout the Eight Min region, with tales like 'Young Master Xiao Inquires at Inns' and 'Mingzhi's Boat Journeys' on every tongue. Endless matchmakers came calling until, during business in Guangzhou, he chanced upon an extraordinary maiden - erudite, virtuous, and graceful. After determined inquiries, he married this Lady Sun Liuyang. Their deep mutual affection saw them often discussing state affairs in private.\n\nAs time flew, Mingzhi's father's condition worsened. Forgoing his planned return to Guangzhou, Mingzhi delegated affairs to trusted lieutenants while attending his father's bedside, emerging only to manage trade, properties, and private militia matters."
NYAB_MIN_2a: "What an exceptional man!"

NYAB_MIN_3_t: "Undercurrents of Trouble"
NYAB_MIN_3_d: "Xiao Mingzhi was tailing a suspicious figure ahead - a servant from the Pu family he recognized despite having only seen him a few times. Recently, the Pu clan had been making unusual moves, liquidating large quantities of goods for silver. Through his information channels, Mingzhi learned they had been stockpiling weapons and hosting unusual numbers of transient personnel. In peaceful times, such military preparations would have drawn official scrutiny, but now the authorities were overwhelmed by the Semu people's disturbances.\n\nThe servant initially showed caution, perhaps from prior experience, but soon relaxed his guard. Mingzhi followed him to a remote warehouse even he, familiar as he was with Quanzhou, had never visited. The servant appeared to be conversing with strangely dressed individuals, handing them something. What were all these crates containing? Mingzhi stealthily peeked inside - military supplies! Combined with the Pu clan's recent activities and the Semu unrest, the truth became undeniable.\n\n'I must warn the authorities,' Mingzhi thought, when accidentally brushing against a crate created noise. Fortunately, his knowledge of Quanzhou's alleys allowed escape after several blocks of frantic running. Safely home, he pondered his next move. The alerted Semu would likely accelerate their plans, clearly harboring sinister secrets. Yet the authorities were no better than bloodsucking leeches, with their increasingly oppressive commercial taxes tormenting Min merchants."
NYAB_MIN_3a: "Report to the authorities."
NYAB_MIN_3b: "Watch and wait."

NYAB_MIN_4_t: "The Second Ispah Rebellion"
NYAB_MIN_4_d: "Quanzhou burned fiercely, its flames illuminating the night sky. The screams and wails of people mingled with the crash of collapsing buildings, each sound piercing Xiao Mingzhi's nerves. The conflict wasn't over - the clamor of battle still echoed in the distance. Urgent horn blasts summoned soldiers to assemble. It seemed the Semu people and their mercenaries were assaulting the city magistrate's residence. But... Mingzhi hesitated as he looked at his family. What if the Semu forces proved too strong? He couldn't gamble with his clan's survival..."
NYAB_MIN_4a: "Gather our belongings and flee north."

NYAB_MIN_6_d: "Step by step, turning back repeatedly amidst the chaos. Quanzhou had passed the point of no return. Resolutely moving forward while leaving behind homeland days that could never be reclaimed, Xiao Mingzhi clenched his fists. He would return. He would return bearing hope. Having contacted his Jiangnan connections who feared the civil war spreading to their doorstep, Mingzhi skillfully appealed to both reason and emotion - all were intelligent people who understood the principle of 'when lips are gone, teeth will be cold'. Upon hearing of Quanzhou's fall, the Jiangnan Connected Paths immediately formed, an alliance primarily composed of Jiangnan's wealthy elites."
NYAB_MIN_6a: "The Connected Paths endure forever!"
NYAB_MIN_6b: "Exterminate all rebels!"

NYAB_MIN_7_t: "The Eight Min Connected Paths"
NYAB_MIN_7_d: "Xiao Mingzhi hadn't sailed in years. Zayton Harbor remained prosperous, with ships from all directions coming and going. Nor had he managed family affairs in ages - now he governed a nation, a far more complex undertaking. Toppling the tyrants and establishing the Connected Paths was but the first step in his grand vision. The comical sight of despots fleeing northward, weighed down by looted gold and jewels, still brought him satisfaction. Stroking the jade seal symbolizing the Connected Paths' mandate, he quietly returned it to the desk."
NYAB_MIN_7a: "The Connected Paths shall endure!"

NYAB_MIN_8_t: "Relief of the Magistrate's Residence"
NYAB_MIN_8_d: "Without hesitation, Xiao Mingzhi led his household troops and reinforcements from allied families toward the magistrate's residence. Valuable time was lost rescuing civilians along the way..."

Countless sons and daughters of China devoted their lives to this vision of universal harmony, where people stand shoulder to shoulder - a world that now seems within reach.\n\nFoolish warlords saw only immediate gains, pawning their moral conscience like collateral, intoxicated by profit and desire.

As the saying goes: 'When Tai Mountain is tranquil, the world is at peace.'\n\nThe comrades of the Connected Paths were radiant with joy, having doubtless dreamed of this moment. Heaven itself smiled upon them with flawless skies. Gazing upon the realm from this foremost of mountains, [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetName] saw the faces of departed comrades appear before them, their voices and expressions vivid as ever.\n\nThe sun seemed to rise from behind Tai Mountain, its glorious rays setting the sky ablaze.

How pitiful that these deluded fools had lived to see this day. Watching the blood-red sunset, [Root.Monarch.Dynarchy.GetName][Root.Monarch.GetName] knew the world could have but one true ruler.\n\nWhat 'people's welfare'? What damned ideals? What beautiful visions? Nothing ever changes - history is but an endless cycle. As [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetName] lit the flames, acrid smoke filled their nostrils - still preferable to the stench of battlefields."
NYAB_MIN_102_d2: "Did beautiful visions truly not exist? [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetName] questioned their heart countless times - to the sun and moon, to the stars, to elders and compatriots, to the departed, to future generations... Ultimately they stayed their hand, still harboring doubts. Amidst their comrades' gasps came the sound of drawn blades. Indeed - if they wouldn't act, others would seize the mantle of ruler.

Whether Confucianism or Legalism, whatever serves their purpose is deemed worthy, resulting in grotesque ethical codes. Yet ancient words declare: 'Are kings and nobles born of special blood?' Those who become princes and generals - were they truly born superior, entitled to exploit others? From Zhi the Rebel's fist to Chen Sheng's staff, we've seen kings change banners in panic. The Connected Paths shall uphold their spirit, achieving what our ancestors could not."

A world where people stand shoulder to shoulder seems just within reach.\n\nFoolish warlords see only immediate gains, as if pawning their own moral conscience, their hearts clouded by profit and desire, hovering between choices. The displaced victims of famine have no leisure to ponder the future, yet in the great cities, the singing and dancing continue unabated.

NYAB_HMU_13_d: "When Xiao Su received the request to host a farewell banquet before his next departure, he readily agreed. As he cheerfully entered the courtyard, his loyal guards were detained outside. Though sensing something amiss, he paid it little mind. Nearing the main hall entrance, specially assigned officers approached him.\n\nWhen soldiers steadied him in the corridor, Xiao Su panicked, shouting 'I came for the banquet! What are you doing?' while kicking and struggling violently. These elite imperial guards skillfully but carefully restrained him, escorting him into the grand hall.\n\nThere, awaiting officials recited the 'Edict of Enthronement.' Before they finished, Xiao Su roared suddenly, breaking free from the guards and lunging toward the official five meters away. Though trained in martial arts and battle-hardened, the imperial personage's precious health couldn't risk injury from such a fall. The official calmly observed Xiao Su's furious outburst with respectful composure.\n\nAt this critical moment, nearby generals reacted swiftly, rushing to surround and restrain Xiao Su, protectively swaddling him in the yellow imperial robe."

NYAB_HMU_14_t: "The Cycle Begins Anew"
NYAB_HMU_14_d: "Every common man has a share of responsibility for the fate of his country; in my love for the nation, how could I lag behind others? But with the multitude bestowing their support, the burden is immense. How should one enrich the people's livelihood? How should one revitalize the nation's strength? The so-called universal sovereign bears a weighty mandate from Heaven—how could it be occupied by one lacking virtue and capability? The esteemed members of the Liandao have striven with fervor and effort for decades, and now they erroneously entrust this heavy responsibility to me. How am I to measure myself? My previous sincere declarations were not mere pretense of modesty, but arose from deep apprehension and unease that I could not suppress. Yet, the people's reproaches grow stricter, their expectations more urgent, leaving me with no means to exonerate myself and no room for evasion!\n\nNow the realm is divided, the sacred vessel changes hands, returning to one of virtue—this is the natural order. Those who command the armies of the realm disregard ethics, usurp the Mandate of Heaven, point to the bright sun and boast of their glory, shoot at the azure sky and dare to deceive, failing to realize their nation approaches ruin, unaware death draws near. Thus, Heaven's Mandate abandons them. Those tasked with defending the northern borders amass troops for self-aggrandizement, rely on their multitudes and force, emphasize arms and militarism, intent only on annexation, with no thought for long-term strategy. Forsaking oaths and breaking promises, committing evils intolerable to the world, they falsely claim Heaven's Mandate, forge prophecies, deceive and confuse the masses, enraging the Supreme Deity—will they not perish? Therefore, their meager virtue and scant capability cannot bear their ambitions; insulting Heaven and Earth, defying the Dao and reason, they ultimately lose the regard of Heaven's Mandate.\n\nAre kings, nobles, and generals born to their stations? Zhang Zhi clenched his fist; Chen She brandished his pole—kings and marquises changed their names and banners in disarray. I, upholding the wishes of the village elders, raised the banner of righteousness, sacrificing myself to the cause for over ten years. It is said that a wise ruler plans for danger to control change, and a loyal minister contemplates difficulties to establish authority. Thus, only an extraordinary person can accomplish extraordinary deeds; only extraordinary deeds can establish extraordinary merits. The extraordinary is surely not what ordinary people can aspire to. The Liandao must uphold this aspiration and accomplish the great enterprise that predecessors could not complete. Now, since Heaven sends no sage to quell the chaotic age, I must comply with the will of the world, risk death to receive the Mandate of Heaven, and open an era of peace for all within the seas that will last for ten thousand generations."

NYAB_HMU_15_t: "Join Sleeves for Shared Victory"
NYAB_HMU_15_d: "Leading the Shaozhou Liandao was none other than Sun Liuyang, wife of Zhemin Liandao's commander Xiao Su. Back when Xiao Su raised his rebellion, fearing Sun Liuyang would be implicated, he sent his wife back to her hometown in advance. However, Sun Liuyang was no delicate woman skilled only in embroidery within women's quarters. Upon returning home, she immediately mobilized her clan's influence and eventually raised the banner of rebellion in Shaozhou as well. As the imperial court offered amnesty and enlistment, both sides were granted official positions, temporarily ceasing hostilities.\n\nNow the realm descends into great chaos once more. Last time, fighting separately proved disadvantageous at every turn; this time, we should join sleeves for shared victory!"
NYAB_HMU_15a: "How can we say we have no robes? We shall share our tunics with you!"

This was self-defense, I had no choice. The moment his 'comrade' drew his sword, Xiao Su preempted him to gain the advantage. The result: he now faced the cold corpse of what was once a warm-hearted brother-in-arms. Failure? Failed, failed, failed... yes. To shatter the darkness, you must become darker than the darkness itself. You can only move forward, by any means necessary."
