DD_UKR_nation_desc:"People of Vladimir, our time has come! Let us rebuild the great nation of the Rus people!"
DD_RUS_1_t:"Unification of Rus"
DD_RUS_1_d:"Though repeatedly swept by disasters, the Rus people have finally regained their footing amidst the storms of fate. The savage alien tribes from the east have at last been expelled from the lands of Rus - their sharp sabers could win bloody victories, but could never subdue the unyielding spirit of the Rus nation. The ancient Rus state, fragmented since the division of the Kievan Grand Principality, finally sees an end to its centuries of turmoil.\n\nThough the northern Rus who fell under pagan occupation have strayed from the righteous path, they remain children of the great Mother Rus. The emerging unified Rus Federation will not only reclaim our divided territories, but also reunite the severed flesh of our people. The once terrifying Mongol Empire loomed like a colossal mountain between the northern and southern Rus, formidable and imposing, but it was destined to be overcome.\n\nGaze upon the mountain, cross the mountain, become the mountain."
DD_RUS_1a:"The ancient giant awakens from the land of decay."

DD_RUS_2_t:"The Division of Rus"
DD_RUS_2_d:"While the northern Rus celebrated their day of victory, the southern Rus remained mired under the brutal oppression of foreign rulers and internecine strife. Though many Rus refused to acknowledge the reality, the identity of the Rus people was gradually fracturing. Due to prolonged separation and varied foreign dominations, the Ruthenian dialect was diverging increasingly from the northern Rus tongue, evolving into a distinct language. Differences in customs and cultural traditions further fueled the perception among both north and south of viewing themselves as two separate communities, each regarding the other as heretical neighbors.\n\nVastly different political environments created a chasm in identity between north and south. The northern Rus believed they were rebuilding the glory of Rus through struggle, viewing their southern kin as cowardly, comfort-seeking traitors who needed to be brought back into the orthodox Rus fold. They contemptuously referred to Ruthenia as 'Little Rus', seeing them as backward and arrogantly delusional separatists. Meanwhile, the southern Rus grew increasingly resentful of their overbearing and aggressive northern brethren."
DD_RUS_2a:""All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way.""

DD_RUS_4_t:"Saint Vladimir"
DD_RUS_4_d:"Vladimir Sviatoslavich, 'the Great' Prince of Novgorod and Kiev, Ruler of Vladimir, foremost among the Princes of Rus. As one of the most significant early members of the Rurik Dynasty, his childhood was marked by turmoil and intrigue. After being driven from his homeland by his brother, Vladimir assembled a force beyond the icy sea, ultimately returning to overthrow his brother in revenge and ascend to the seat of power in Kiev, his life forever intertwined with cunning and violence.\n\nIn the remainder of his reign, the Grand Prince nearly achieved mastery over all of Rus, pacifying the Poles and awing the Romans. More significantly, he brought the holy Christian faith of Rome to the Rus people, granting our nation eternal salvation. Vladimir established the faith of the Eastern Church as the state religion and compelled his subjects to convert. Pagan idols were cast into the Dnieper River, and the entire populace, immersed in the sacred waters, received the Baptism of Rus.\n\nThe Grand Prince was canonized as a saint by both the Catholic and Orthodox Churches after his death, remembered by this land as the unifier of the Rus people and their faith."
DD_RUS_4a:"May the lands beloved by Saint Vladimir endure forever."
DD_RUS_4a_tt:"All §YOrthodox§! countries gain access to the icon '§YIcon of Saint Vladimir§!'.\n"
DD_RUS_5_t:"Saint Alexander"
DD_RUS_5_d:"Alexander Yaroslavich, Grand Prince of Novgorod, Kiev, and Vladimir, better known as Alexander Nevsky, earned his epithet after achieving a decisive victory against a larger force of Baltic pagans assembled by a Lithuanian ruler on the frozen waters at the mouth of the Neva River, thereby defending Novgorod and all of Rus from the heathen horde. That year, the hero of the Neva stood firm on the borders of the frozen realm.\n\nYet, in the eyes of many Rus, Nevsky's noble soul was forever left beneath the ice of the lake. Following the epic Battle on the Ice, the suffering frozen lands endured the ravages and slaughter of the Mongols. Facing the tide of the Tatar cavalry, Alexander chose to skillfully maneuver around the Mongols, acting as an intermediary between the Mongols and the Rus to mitigate the slaughter and plunder inflicted upon his people. Under the Mongol yoke, Alexander seized opportunities to suppress revolts while striving to protect the embers of the Rus nation. Though perhaps misunderstood in his time, and despite enduring hatred and vilification, Alexander steadily worked to reunify the Rus people in his own way, awaiting the day when the chains of the Tatars would be utterly shattered.\n\nAmong most Rus, perceptions of Alexander vary widely, ranging from the knight who sacrificed himself for his country on the frozen lake to a despicable traitor who sold out his homeland for personal gain. However, in recent years he has gained increasing understanding and reverence, and the Church canonized Alexander Nevsky as a saint in 1547. The man who betrayed everything, ultimately gave both his life and his soul for Mother Rus."
DD_RUS_5a:"Praise or blame matters little; only the restoration of the lost realm."
DD_RUS_5a_tt:"All §YOrthodox§! countries gain access to the icon '§YIcon of Saint Alexander§!'.\n"
DD_RUS_6_t:"The Great Northern War"
DD_RUS_6_d:"The lands north of the Baltic have long been a desolate snowfield, where only savage Viking marauders warred amongst themselves. However, the sudden declaration of war by the Norsemen has disrupted the delicate balance in the northern realms. They seek to reclaim Novgorod, or Holmgard as they call it. The chaos of war has left the already turbulent White Sea successively dominated by increasingly rampant pirates of all stripes.\n\nThe burgeoning greed of the Rus merchants of Novgorod is now almost undisguised in its ambitions for the Baltic, yet the Hanseatic League will never easily relinquish this prosperous trade hub, and the ambitions of the Lion of the North will not be satisfied with the status quo. Now the entire north stands on the eve of a great war. This fragile peace may soon be shattered, and conflict will rage across the seas until a true King in the North arises."
DD_RUS_6_d2:"The lands north of the Baltic have long been a desolate snowfield, where only savage Viking marauders warred amongst themselves. However, the sudden involvement of the Swedes has disrupted the delicate balance in the northern realms.
