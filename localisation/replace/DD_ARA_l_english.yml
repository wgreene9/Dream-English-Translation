DD_ARA.0.d: "Another evening, [Root.Monarch.GetName] removed the crown and journeyed west along the shell-marked Way of St. James, its stones stained with blood. Pyrenean snowmelt soaked through rough hemp robes, carving meandering prayers along the Ebro's banks, while pilgrim bells awakened cruciform scars slumbering in the bedrock.\n\nWhen Compostela's morning bells shook loose the last stardust, the king's tattered cloak already shimmered with the radiance of twelve apostles. Upon the return saddle, besides dew-kissed thorns and flint gifted by fellow pilgrims, rested the gaze of all Iberia - merchants sketching the ascetic's silhouette on ledger pages, Arab scholars charting his footsteps among constellations, even the proudest highlanders crossing themselves at his snow-dampened footprints. And [Root.Monarch.GetName] simply tightened the cloak, gently brushing off pilgrimage dust. This devotion, he knew, was a crown heavier than any imperial diadem."

DD_ARA.1.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName], the eternal pillar of Aragon's golden crown, weaves Iberia's most intricate web of statecraft with rosary beads and olive branches. His devout silhouette at morning prayers contrasts with his tolerant posture when studying star charts with Moorish scholars at night - these dual images refract through Valencia's stained glass in discordant halos. He can recite Psalm 137 in Latin before the Roman Curia, then soothe restless Moorish nobles with Arabic proverbs in the converted Santa María Mosque. The Peninsular faction sees him as their destined leader, while the Latin faction detects political genius in his casual talks with Southern French princes. When Granada's minarets and Toledo's crosses stand opposed at dusk, only this monarch transforms fractured council chambers into a chessboard of nations: granting Catalan merchants Venetian-style charters, bestowing Burgundian-style honors on Aragonese nobles, even making papal envoys praise his vineyards' wine as 'new covenant vessels for Christ's blood.'\n\nYet this saint who extinguishes wars with smiles shows uncharacteristic hesitation toward his only son Miguel. Born in the bloodstained swaddling of a Gascon princess, the boy's eyes hold prematurely matured mysteries - he quotes the Song of Songs when pleading for heretics in confession, yet shatters lances of Crusader descendants in tournaments. Court astrologers detect the ill-omened 'Two-Faced Janus' in star charts Miguel drew at eight; Moorish musicians hear echoes of Córdoba's flowery palace in his improvised Andalusian melodies. As Aragonese night winds whistle through Alhambra-esque latticework, the king hears Fate whisper: this heir who inherited all his gifts and secrets will either ignite Iberia or shroud its golden age."

If the Kingdom of Aragon wishes to stride onto a broader stage, it must make its definitive choice amidst intensifying factional strife. The time has come to arbitrate with quenched steel rather than withering flowers - whether to let the Fleurs-de-lis of Southern France rot along the Ebro's banks, or have Valencia's Carnations drown in Mediterranean salt spray - but never again shall the crown hover above mirages of bygone dreams."

He grew in his father's shadow, his soul forever imprisoned in that lonely, stifling garden.\n\nThus when his succession was challenged domestically by his brothers, Carlos's position became precarious. Yet regardless, he remains Carlos I's eldest son and Asturias' rightful heir. Perhaps we should support Carlos's claim to Asturias' throne - his crown could become our key to Iberia's halls of power.

That crown, steeped in Navarre's century-long twilight, refracted a new brilliance under the stained glass of the cathedral the moment he took the scepter. The waves of the western Mediterranean transformed into threads of statecraft at his fingertips, while the sails of Genoese merchant ships and the scimitars of Barbary pirates became alternating emblems upon Aragon's royal seal.\n\nNow, as both the golden lilies and date palms bow before our banners, the morning breeze of Albarracín still carries whispers of old companions—those days when we shared the morning dew of the Ebro, those nights when we charted the stars atop the peaks of Sierra de Sobrarbe. Their warmth remains etched upon the cliffs of the Pyrenean passes. Let Aragon's olive branches intertwine once more with Navarre's pomegranate flowers. Let our armor turn to silver under Zaragoza's moonlight, filled with the rich bouquet of Gascon wine, offered before the thrones of those who once guarded Iberia's starry skies together."

DD_ARA.5.t: "The Remorseful Memory"  
DD_ARA.5.d: "Whenever dusk soaked through the rose window tracery of the Aragonese palace, [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s fingers would unconsciously trace the wedding ring inlaid with Gascon irises. The laurels of Valencia still whispered in the wind of that distant autumn night—when the sixteen-year-old princess from southern France lifted her gaze from behind the iris-patterned gauze curtains, the young prince saw not the spark of love in the amber wine, but the heavy chains of two kingdoms being forged. The brocade bed curtains of their marriage became the most exquisite political veil; he meticulously calculated the intervals between embraces, turning every touch into a prayer offered to the Holy Father, even the gasps of desire tamed into poetic meter.\n\nThat queen, always draped in misty blue-gray silk like morning fog, quietly seeped into every corner of the court, much like the perpetual haze over Barcelona's harbor. On nights when [Root.Monarch.GetName] pored over treaties with France, she would gently push a silver-rosary box toward the candlelight; when he debated astrology with Moorish envoys, her embroidery frame would unfurl Cordoban geometric patterns at just the right moment. Until one stormy night, when her handmaidens found the queen leaning against the balcony railing, letting the rain wash the pearls from her hair into a scattering of pale stars on the ground. That soaked silk gown was later folded into a carved sandalwood box, its creases like dried-up riverbeds.\n\nWhen the revelry of San Juan's feast lit up the sky, fate tore the last warmth into shreds. The frantic footsteps and midwives' prayers in the birthing chamber were finally pierced by a feeble cry. As [Root.Monarch.GetName] rushed into the room thick with herbs and blood, the queen's golden hair was already drenched in cold sweat, her pale fingers still clutching the linen swaddle embroidered with fleur-de-lis. The blood spreading beneath the lambskin bedding sprawled like wild roses, while the physician's trembling hands pressed uselessly against the ruptured veins. *'His eyes… like when you looked at me,'* she whispered with the faintest smile, trying to turn the infant's face toward her husband—but all she managed was a bloodstained fingertip brushing the child's soft cheek.\n\nThat night, the stars of Aragon seemed shattered in the queen's silver mirror. [Root.Monarch.GetName] knelt before the cooling bed and, for the first time, truly saw the fine lines at the corners of her eyes—those marks of time he had deliberately ignored, now more winding and profound than the maps of Catalonia. The newborn's cries echoed through the stone corridors, the warmth of the swaddle fading with his wife's last breath into the dawn mist, becoming a remorse no devout soul could confess."  
DD_ARA.5.a: "Those we loved too late, and those we dared not love."  

DD_ARA.6.t: "The Unmendable Rift"
DD_ARA.6.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s quill hovered over the parchment, the ink pooling into a weighty shadow. He lifted his gaze to the far end of the long table—where Miguel stirred his honeyed tea with a silver spoon, the delicate chime of porcelain against gilded tray more unnerving than any council chamber quarrel.\n\n'You shouldn't have yielded the Andorran valley's iron mines to Gascon merchants,' Miguel deliberately flattened his tone, as if taming a headstrong Barbary stallion. 'Pyrenean snowmelt can nourish soil, but it can also drown rash promises.' His lashes flickered; the spoon traced spirals in the tea, silently mirroring his father's diplomatic circumlocutions.\n\nThe sudden rain against the rose window sharpened. The young man stood abruptly, his sleeve brushing the unfurled map—Navarre's borders smeared by wine stains into blurred wounds. 'You always say snowmelt tempers blades,' he plucked a fleur-de-lis chess piece, rolling it between his fingers, 'but what if the hand wielding the sword goes numb?' Before the words settled, the piece clicked into the carved silver box bearing Aragon's crown, stirring a plume of dust.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s knuckles whitened against the table's edge. He remembered that blood-hued dawn fifteen years prior, when Miguel's wails had pierced deeper than any diplomatic missive. Now the boy's silhouette merged with his late wife's blue-gray silk gown in the rainstorm, their turns away from him identical in curvature. The fleur-de-lis seal on the parchment's corner bled with rainwater, uncannily like the spreading bloodstains on the birthing sheets years ago.\n\nWhen servants gingerly cleared the cold tea service, they found the king mute before emptiness. The wavering candlelight stretched his shadow long—a rusted scepter lying across the unbridgeable chasm between father and son."
DD_ARA.6.a: "'The sharpest blades, it seems, are always sheathed in what we mistake for warmth.'"

DD_ARA.7.t: "The Legacy of Glory"
DD_ARA.7.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] stood beneath the newly restored dome of the Córdoba Library, fingers tracing the gilded Quran and Latin Bible displayed side by side. Sunlight streamed through stained glass adorned with Stars of David and crosses, weaving a shimmering tapestry across the arabesque-inlaid marble floor.\n\nOutside in the newly built 'Fountain of Three Saints' courtyard, stone figures of Christian saints, Jewish prophets, and Islamic scholars encircled the central spring, its waters polishing bronze discs inscribed with scriptures from all three faiths. He removed his rosary and gently draped it around the neck of Averroes' statue, forever frozen in contemplation of his astrolabe.\n\nNight winds carried the scent of frankincense and myrrh through the corridors as [Root.Monarch.GetName] gazed at the flickering lights along the southern horizon. Twelve envoys bearing poetry and star charts had already mounted their mules—their saddlebags holding not only peace accords, but Prince Miguel's co-authored 'Dialogues of the Stars' with Moorish musicians.\n\n'To conquer land is lesser than to conquer time,' he whispered to a circling owl, thumb brushing the bronze key that fused crucifix and horseshoe arch motifs:\n\n'When the children of Taifas recite Scripture in our churches, they shall understand—Iberia's stars have always turned beneath the same canopy.'"
DD_ARA.7.a: "'May they understand.'"
DD_ARA.7_shijianqianzhanwenben: "This event heralds our march toward the southern Taifas."

DD_ARA.8.t: "The Final Victor"
DD_ARA.8.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] rode through Seville's Golden Gate, his steed trampling pomegranate blossoms and olive branches carpeting the streets. Bronze bells tolled simultaneously from twelve converted temples—once churches and mosques—their clappers forged by Cordoban craftsmen fusing cross patterns with Kufic Arabic script, the soundwaves blending into honey-hued halos. Women tore their treasured silks into ribbons—Granada's crimson, Barcelona's gold, Toledo's silver-gray—draping them over the surviving arches of Roman aqueducts, distant as the abandoned harpstrings of gods.\n\nThe king's gilded armor reflected the midday sun, its breastplate inlaid with an astrolabe smelted from the crown of Asturias. When he reached the Guadalquivir's banks, the water suddenly bloomed with thousands of candle-lit lotus lamps—Moorish artisans' special creations, their parchment shades inscribed with verses from the Song of Songs in both Latin and Arabic. Across the river, in the newly built hybrid chapel, a Christian organ harmonized with an Andalusian oud, playing Prince Miguel's 'Cosmic Roundelay.'\n\nAt dusk, nine hundred poets from across the realms ascended the ruins of the Alcázar's flower-filled courtyards, reciting trilingual epics before the remnants of an ancient observatory. [Root.Monarch.GetName] sat alone on the high platform, gazing at an Asturian wine-filled chalice inlaid with mother-of-pearl—its liquid reflecting a perfect map of the stars. As he raised the cup, all noise ceased but the harbor's distant shanties carried by the wind:\n\n'Behold, even Gibraltar's rocks sip moonlight!'\n\nThe revelry lasted seven dawns. People collapsed asleep under pomegranate trees hung with Venetian mirrors, unfinished wine fermenting in jars like violet sunrise. The king stepped over slumbering musicians, tracing the chapel's stained glass—where someone had scratched nearly invisible Hebrew letters with a diamond stylus between the cracks:\n\n'Your feast shall drown in tears.'\n\nHe paused at this prophecy finer than spider silk, slowly turning his breastplate's astrolabe toward the rising sun. The reflected light engulfed the inscription, its searing rays melting the ancient warning into a meaningless golden streak. At the distant port, the last ships carrying demobilized knights raised their sails. Aragon's royal banner unfurled like a phoenix reborn—yet none noticed three black threads woven into its Granada-silk edges, each spun from different latitudes."

DD_ARA.9.t: "The Unhealed Scar"
DD_ARA.9.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s fingers traced the coiled grapevines on the Ivrea crest, the gold-threaded leaves writhing like veins in the candlelight. Princess Beatrice's portrait leaned against the desk, the pearls at her ears refracting the dusk light of Dijon Castle—that pale gold hue so reminiscent of the moonstones in the Gascon princess' hair twenty years prior.\n\n'Burgundy's canals can float Flemish wool, or drown France's fleur-de-lis gardens,' the Chancellor's counsel echoed under the vaulted ceiling, the golden threads on the parchment map stitching Aragon and Burgundy into a falcon's spread wings. Yet [Root.Monarch.GetName] saw only his sixteen-year-old reflection in the gilded frame: that stiff-shouldered boy at the end of Valencia's gallery, his ceremonial robes slipping to reveal sweat-stained panic in every fold.\n\nThe council chamber doors burst open, shattering the memory. Miguel stormed in, night dew clinging to his clothes, hay from the stables in his hair, gripping a Damascus dagger fragment bartered from Moorish merchants. 'So you'd collar me with the Golden Fleece?' He drove the blade into the oak table in challenge, its turquoise-inlaid hilt matching the princess' eyes in the portrait.\n\nThe old king's throat tightened around unspoken reprimands. He remembered his wedding night—the mechanical unfastening of his wife's gown, the pearl buttons clattering louder than cathedral bells. Now Beatrice's painted smile seemed to melt into the Gascon princess' dying quiver of lips.\n\nWhen Miguel's footsteps faded down the corridor, [Root.Monarch.GetName] gathered the crest's shattered pieces—broken vines oozing gold like sealing wax, slowly smothering a scar that had never healed in twenty years."

DD_ARA.10.t: "Exiled Moonlight"
DD_ARA.10.d: "Miguel's childhood years were pearls lodged between the crevices of Aragon's crown. While [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s scepter could cast towering shadows in the council chamber, he could never brush away the scorn and curses clinging to his youngest son's garments. Miguel's fragile beauty—more delicate than moonlight—his pallid complexion betraying Southern French blood, his tragic past and solitary nature drew malicious whispers through palace corridors. Vicious young falcons hid daggers in velvet gloves, probing his unhealed maternal loss with poisoned words. Gradually, he withdrew from peers, preferring the solitude of the library's Arabic star charts.\n\nOne dawn, in the rhombus of light filtering through Alhambra-style latticework, the young prince noticed the maid who always cleaned astrolabes after matins. Kneeling on glazed tiles to gather Arabic manuscripts torn by the archbishop, strands of ebony hair escaping her linen headscarf reminded him of Andalusian twilight in picture books. 'If His Highness permits, I might mend these shattered stars,' she murmured, arranging fragments across her lap, her fingers moving in patterns mirroring ancient celestial paths. As Miguel watched eagerly, she threaded gold wire through rhino-horn punctures, soothing him: 'A lone sail in a storm often reaches harbor first.' Her voice held the luster of mother-of-pearl edging his mother's portrait frame—soft yet honed by ocean waves.\n\nOn his tenth birthday night, Miguel discovered his mother's Provençal love poems hidden in the library's secret compartment, their yellowed margins filled with fresh Córdoban script annotations. When the trembling boy read aloud the vermilion-underlined verse—'His blood shall be the undercurrents of Garonne and Ebro'—silk and silver chains rustled behind him: 'Her Majesty wrote poetry in many tongues, just as His Majesty rules many faiths.' The clink of porcelain on marble startled him; the maid knelt two paces away with almond milk, her patched hemp sleeves contrasting with tray ornaments polished brighter than a cardinal's crozier. Moonlight fused their shadows onto the wall's dynastic tree, like Gascony's iris once merging with Aragon's bedrock.\n\nThat night, Valencia's constellations quietly shifted—the cursed son of Janus had finally found moonlight strong enough to dispel his mist."

DD_ARA.11.t: "The Royal Wedding of True Love"
DD_ARA.11.d: "When Valencia's autumn wind carried the first plane tree leaf, Miguel clasped Zayda's hands—roughened by years of lye and bleach—against the weathered stone walls of the council chamber. With one hand, he traced the calluses that chronicled her exile; with the other, he unfurled star charts copied through the night. 'These coordinates sketch no constellation,' his voice mingled with distant blacksmith strikes, 'but every skylight we've shared.'\n\nZayda shed the coarse headscarf of her former life, letting Sevillian ebony hair cascade in the confessional's candlelight. At her conversion, she knelt where kings had worn grooves into the stone, repeating prayers in two tongues. Holy water trembled in the archbishop's aspergillum, mirroring how she'd once wiped the mocked prince's tears in an observatory well.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] watched from the watchtower's shadow as wedding bells shook Valencia's ancient walls. He remembered the scorched olive groves he'd ridden through in youth—now budding anew for his son's chosen bride. 'Tell the Privy Council,' he told stunned attendants, 'Aragon's next queen once saved a plague-stricken poet with a loaf of bread.'\n\nNo gilded bridges or pagan jewels adorned their procession. When barges carried the couple through humble canals, washerwomen and scribes lined the banks holding clay jars. Zayda cast not gems but rosemary-seed paper boats onto the waters—come spring, they'd sprout into green waterways uniting both shores.\n\nThat night in the library, Miguel wrote with his mother's quill along the margins of Zayda's mended parchments: 'True crowns are the scars we've healed together.'"

DD_ARA.12.t: "Fading Colors"
DD_ARA.12.d: "When [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s decree struck the library like autumn's last thunderclap, Miguel was proofreading the newly translated Toledan Star Tables with Zayda. The royal scepter's shadow fell across the map's fissures as Burgundy's betrothal document smothered their freshly marked celestial coordinates. 'Depart in seven days,' the parchment scraped against Zayda's half-mended apron, leaving a wine-dark crease.\n\nOn the wedding eve, Valencia's laundresses stitched Burgundian gold thread into the ceremonial garb, yet stubborn winds kept snapping their needles. Miguel walked barefoot through the corridor, hearing Zayda clean stained glass in the chapel—always when moonlight tilted toward Seville. The saints' visages merged with her silhouette in the dark, and he suddenly remembered her tracing river currents on his ten-year-old palm with lye-stained fingers.\n\n'Your Highness, the wedding boots await fitting.'\n\nAt dawn, Zayda knelt by the door with silvered spurs, torn star chart drafts peeking from her apron pocket. Miguel's grip on her wrist sent ripples across the copper basin's surface. 'Tell me how Sevillian ballads end their elopement tales,' his breath stirred dried jasmine at her headscarf's edge. She only wound the spur straps thrice more—until the spikes pressed into her own palm.\n\n'The ballads' knights... learn to conquer undercurrents within charted courses.'\n\nBurgundy's golden lilies on the wedding carriage wept dew in the morning mist like unfallen tears. As parchment-scented wind swept the plaza, Zayda appeared at the cloister's end with armfuls of laundry, her headscarf billowing like Seville's banner. In the curtain's final descent, Miguel glimpsed the star chart she'd bleached inside his doublet—marking their jointly discovered rogue star, now blazing southward."

DD_ARA.20.d: "Badajoz's star fort glowed with the rusted iron-oxide hue of hematite in twilight, sulfurous smoke from blast craters veiling the surrender envoy's face. The magistrate had forged their capitulation from prisoner-miners' shackle filings—seven bronze wolves biting jagged edges into the parchment, each indentation pooling with half-dried mule blood that congealed into ancient runes in the evening wind.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s armored boots crushed freshly unearthed Roman aqueduct shards, the grinding noise against obsidian floors startling the hound curled beside siege diagrams. As the Burgundian engineer's hourglass drained its final quartz grains, the king flipped it with his swordtip, swirling gold dust with moonlight leaking through the breached ramparts into glittering mist.\n\nThe envoy proffered the blood-and-rust streaked surrender document by torchlight, but [Root.Monarch.GetName] scooped Western Range hematite onto his blade. Red-black grains slid down the tilted metal, sketching unfinished ore veins in the battering ram's shadow. The scribe's thrice-wetted quill froze mid-word, blurring 'mining concessions' into ink-clouds.\n\nWhen sappers sought approval to ignite the eighth blast charge, the king pressed bronze wolf fangs into unsigned treaty margins. Amid the screech of metal on parchment, prisoner miners' hammering synchronized with Aragonese swords being whetted—a resonant growl through gunpowder haze. [Root.Monarch.GetName] suddenly hurled his cloak at the sand table, the gust flinging three bronze fangs airborne while sulfur smoke momentarily obscured the crimson lion banner.\n\nThe tenth lunar-phase bell tolled from the watchtower as unsealed surrender terms curled near the forge's dying embers. The siege tower's winch remained suspended three cubits short, while the western sky tore apart between thunderheads and minefire sparks."

DD_ARA.21.d: "Seville's orange blossoms ceased their fragrance in the siege's third month. The Guadalquivir reflected galleys chained at anchor—ships meant for distant shores now crowded with Aragonese crossbowmen surveying breached walls. The city council had minted their surrender document from molten coins, while Gypsy fortune-tellers planted seven notched daggers into the terms: preserving Flamenco taverns' all-night revelry, and the privilege to bind Inquisition records in Cordovan leather.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] stood before the Gold Tower's observation slit, crumbling a dried orange segment fallen from the envoy's robe. The scribe waited all night with parchment bearing Seville's wax seal until dawn dew blurred its Latin calligraphy. Across the river, captive musicians improvised Aragonese war songs on three-stringed lutes, their tremolos entwining with siege tower winches, fermenting into ambiguous sighs in the humid mist.\n\nAs bishops anointed the battering ram with holy oil, the king unfastened his Order of Santiago gold chain and tossed it onto the stone ledge. The pendant's impact cracked the treaty's edge, sending twelve rubies tumbling into wet ink. A derelict citrus barge drifted downstream, its leaking juice carving garish golden trails through turbid waters—Seville's final bargaining chips, adrift awaiting judgment."

As [Root.Monarch.GetName] lifted the tent flap, he saw the envoy kneeling in mud, raising a bronze tray: three pomegranate seeds embedded in honey-congealed surrender terms, silently pleading to preserve spice markets and wool dye-works.\n\nThe Aragonese monarch flicked away the tray's brocade with his sword, the metallic clang scattering ravens feasting on corpses twenty paces distant. The army bishop clutched his Book of Kings unspeaking, while Burgundian mercenaries thrust torches into scorched earth by the moat.\n\nAt duskfall, [Root.Monarch.GetName] stood alone before the splintered gates. His fingers traced a torn Quran page drifting through the cracks, as the Alhambra's minarets fractured the last sunlight into shards. In the siege tower's shadow, the scribe waited with unsealed parchment, his quill's frozen ink glinting like icicles."

DD_ARA.23.d: "As Iberia's final beacon guttered out in Gibraltar's salty winds, Barcelona's bells shattered millennia of clouds with seven harmonies. Seville's orange trees bore bicolored fruit in April—half stained pomegranate-red from Granada, half snow-white from Navarrese meltwater. [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s coronation cloak, woven from Catalan sailcloth, shimmered with Andalusian silverwork stars and crescents, each fold shedding gold dust mingled with Castilian wheat.\n\nThe Alhambra's fountains first flowed with waters blessed by three faiths. Moorish musicians recomposed the Song of Songs in Latin, while rabbis transcribed Psalms in Arabic calligraphy. Lisbon fishermen wove nets shaped like the peninsula, each knot hung with pagan temple bells and monastery crosses. In Zaragoza's plaza, turbaned Berber merchants and sword-girt Castilian knights shared wine jars, drunkenly debating whether Tunisian sea charts or Toledan star maps held truer meridians.\n\nAt nightfall, Valencia's stained glass blazed with nine hundred beeswax candles, silhouettes of ancestral kings floating in the glow: León warriors with broken spears dancing with Granadan sultans' ghosts, their shattered glass footprints becoming unnamed Mediterranean isles. [Root.Monarch.GetName] stood at the center, casting the cracked parliament stones into a furnace—the molten metal became ship anchors before cooling, their moonlit reflections stretching into silver chains across the sea.\n\nCheers climbed Iberia's bell towers like Duero grapevines, as Barcelona's aged bishop raised a chalice and glimpsed not just Christ's blood sedimented at its base, but a briny blue that belonged to the Mediterranean."

[Root.Monarch.GetName] sat astride his Frankish-emblazoned warhorse, silver armor refracting prismatic light from Santiago Cathedral's dome—where shimmered the ghostly golden eagle of Charlemagne's coronation and the melted remains of Navarre's crown, now reforged as a crucifix.\n\nZaragoza's triumphal arch bore a monstrous monstrance forged from Andalusian scimitars and Berber shields, its glass prison holding Córdoba's last mosque crescent. In Barcelona's harbor, Genoese artisans converted the defeated Granadan sultan's enameled palanquin into a mobile altar, its 4,000 rubies replaced with papal-blessed saintly relics. Frankish heavy cavalry trampled Seville's orange groves, the crushed fruit mingling with tattered Quran pages to ferment into something resembling Aquitaine wine's tart bouquet.\n\nAt Burgos' castle hall, converted Moorish nobles recited the Nicene Creed in halting Latin, their silk robes patched with silver crosses marking captive status. Provençal minstrels played variations of the Song of Roland on broken-lute lutes, their soundboxes hiding tracings of Pamplona's battle-scarred walls. During [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s coronation, twelve chainmail-clad bishops lifted his ermine cloak with Frankish longswords—revealing a lining embroidered with Lotharingia's division map, where Pyrenean snowlines had been stitched southward to the Atlas Mountains' feet.\n\nCheers stretched taut as crossbow strings across Iberian skies when [Root.Monarch.GetName] cast his sword from Lisbon's cliffs—the blade's quivering upon impact coinciding with Atlantic tides shifting eastward. Astrologers trembled as they reported: the sword's shadow matched Charlemagne's sundial when he marched on Rome."

DD_ARA.25.t: "The Vanishing Lone Star"
DD_ARA.25.d: "As morning mist—like lye-soaked linen—shrouded the wedding carriage, Miguel's fingers unconsciously traced the patched sleeve where Zayda had embroidered the Big Dipper's seventh star with golden thread. Burgundian maids fastened his sash with silver bells, each chime recalling how copper clothespins clattered when Zayda hung laundry by Aragonese washbasins.\n\nDew from church steps seeped into his wedding boots while Beatrice's veil fluttered rebelliously in persistent winds. Kneeling at the altar, Miguel noticed an uncleaned smudge on the stained glass—exactly where Zayda's favorite library nook would align. The bishop's Latin vows washed over him with a scent of moss, suddenly conjuring that stormy night when Zayda traced star paths with bleach on stone, their knees occupying the same damp imprint.\n\n'Exchange the rings.'\n\nThe Burgundian princess' band scraped his knuckle, its inner engraving inexplicably stinging. Miguel's vow caught in his throat, though he numbly completed the performance.\n\nDuring the banquet's roast pheasant course, a servant presented an anonymously donated Valencian Star Catalog. On its last page, fresh Cordoban script coiled like Seville's secret aqueducts: 'True stars never repent their orbits.' The parchment smelled of lye and bitter orange blossoms. When he rushed to the balcony, Burgundy's moon was devouring clouds into the shape of an observatory's spiral skylight.\n\nMidnight bells ground against cobblestones as the groom's attire lay discarded in the dressing room. Miguel walked barefoot through corridors, the chilled tiles reminiscent of Zayda's perpetually polished library floors. By dawn's return, the new Burgundian prince found gold dust on bed curtains—flecks from shredded vows matching Zayda's chart-mending thread. Beyond Aragon's walls, a laundress hummed Andalusian tunes while soaking bloodstained linen in the wash pool. There, in the water's reflection, the seventh star had slipped its ordained course."
DD_ARA.25.a: "'Farewell, my love.'"

DD_ARA.26.t: "The Fading Star"
DD_ARA.26.d: "As the gilded carriage wheels crushed palace steps, Miguel's nails dug deep into Burgundian-embroidered cushions. Dawn mist seeped through the carriage, carrying the scent of lye and bitter orange blossoms—the unique fragrance of Zayda's washing pools. When a stubborn wind flung the curtains open, his eyes met crooked star carvings on a roadside marker—the very constellation they'd charted together one stormy night with her hairpin.\n\nMiguel tore the silver-belled sash from his wrist, its snapping threads startling crows. His leap into the fog ended with wedding robes snagging on carriage ornaments, the ripping fabric echoing childhood star charts torn to shreds. After tumbling through rosemary bushes, his stinging palms recalled Zayda's healing hands always laced with crushed jasmine.\n\nAt Aragon's western aqueduct, Zayda's washing mallet hovered above the pool where the Big Dipper's reflection shattered into silver shards. 'May underground rivers guide all stray stars,' she whispered—a Sevillian exile's prayer—until moss crackled behind her.\n\nMiguel stood knee-deep in mire, his wedding finery studded with burrs. Clutching a willow branch, he raised a bloodstained star chart fragment torn from the carriage lining: 'You taught me to navigate every tributary... yet now drown your own currents?'\n\nThe mallet's splash startled silver fish as Miguel flung his wedding ring into stone crevices. Taking Zayda's lye-roughened hands, he pressed them to his bleeding chest: 'Come—to where no maps dare mark.' Jasmine petals from her hair became swimming stars in the pool. When she loosed her Sevillian ebony tresses, Miguel glimpsed his Gascon mother's portrait smiling in dawnlight.\n\nBy the time [Root.Monarch.GetName] arrived, only a waterlogged wedding robe remained, its embroidered crest now mossy nebulae. Beyond the walls, stableboys swore they'd seen two gray horses—laden with astrolabes—vanishing southward, their hoofprints sprouting rosemary brighter than any crown jewels."

Plagues, exploitation, and wars left Aragonese farms deserted, with dwindling populations causing rural economies to collapse.\n\nFacing oppressive policies, serfs either fled or rebelled. Aragonese monarchs vacillated—issuing decrees abolishing serfdom one year, then conceding to nobles the next. Now, as the kingdom's focus shifted from Aragon's mountains to eastern coasts, Catalans increasingly felt their homeland crumbling.\n\nKings both supported nobles' efforts to control peasants and granted special privileges to raise peasant armies against increasingly rebellious nobility—yet rural decay continued unabated. Bishop of Elne's desperate report to Barcelona described Catalan towns disintegrating: knights wandering on mules, pirates running rampant, and escalating conflicts between peasants and lords protesting 'excessive' peasant rights. Without action, Aragon would soon face simultaneous peasant uprisings and noble revolts."

Now, after centuries, the edict's provisions still faithfully hold force, making the Kingdom a haven for diverse cultures and faiths.\n\nBut this is no longer the age of the Albigensian Crusade. Enforcement faces growing resistance. While religious diversity draws papal condemnation, it has also planted seeds of instability in Aragon.

These French knights became one of the monarchy's few standing military forces, an elite guard for the royal house.\n\nBut today, Latin nobles compete to place their sons in the Royal Knight Order. The order has become bloated with unnecessary redundancy—no longer the kingdom's sharp blade, but rather a burden dragging Aragon down. The Peninsular faction nobles demand the king disband these expensive, ineffective, and questionable knights. Yet regardless, these knights remain Aragon's sharpest sword—though who truly wields it remains unresolved."

Tracing the sound to the riverbank, he found a basket where a baby girl gazed at him curiously from her coarse swaddling clothes.\n\nAs he bent down, pilgrim's dust fell from his cloak into her sapphire eyes, stirring whirlpools like the Catalan Sea. Fernando's finger hovered above her curled lashes, as if touching the father-son bond shattered by political alliances—the Burgundian bride forced upon Miguel, the Andalusian love poems crushed under lawbooks and scepters, all now transformed into the frankincense scent clinging to the infant's wraps.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] unfastened his ermine cloak embroidered with Aragon's arms, wrapping the child in fabric still warm with battlefield smoke and penitent candle wax.

Rebels gathered in abandoned monastery vaults where candlelight cast the Virgin's shadow over moldy tax stacks. Oriol scrawled with vine juice: 'When warhorses devour the last wheat shoots, even field mice will sound the charge.'\n\nThe uprising began on a frostfall night. Peasants folded conscription notices into boats floating down Ebro tributaries, each carrying an olive oil-soaked charcoal lump—century-old lamp fuel Oriol's mother had hoarded before dying. As firechains snaked across the river, rebels pried open granaries with rusted pitchforks; in oat and hempseed avalanches, some saw Oriol melting noble crests into plowshares, molten iron suturing the land's cracks like arteries healing earth's wounds."

Acrid sweetness filled nearby shops: bakers kneaded torn tax ledgers into dough, their baguettes cracking like Catalonia's parched riverbeds; forge bellows spat flaming ledger ashes over Oriol's mother's olive grove, startling larks carrying wheat stalks.\n\nThe day rebels' bodies were dumped into the Ebro, fishermen netted mossy stones each carved with crude plowshares. During the brightest moon, granary oats mysteriously fermented as nightwatchmen swore they saw Oriol's ghost rustling through grain piles, his sickle weaving spiderwebs into new star charts.\n\nA decade later at sowing season, an old farmer found half-melted heraldry in cracked furrows. Hanging it by grass rope over his grandson's cradle, the metal chimed like windchimes with each infant wail.

DD_ARA_farmer_disaster.6.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s chest was pierced by a rusted plowshare, his blood seeping onto the damask sash in eerie harmony with wheat grains in the threshing floor's cracks. Peasant rebels flung parchment deeds into the air with pitchforks—shattered crests swirling like locusts in drought season. The fallow land rights once bound by Latin contracts now fueled women's violent cooking fires.\n\nMiguel's leather armor bore mill dust, the husk in his scabbard matching his childhood toy spear's broken tip. As he knelt, [Root.Monarch.GetName] saw in his son's calloused palms the Gascon princess's deathbed linen—its folds mirroring torn tax scrolls. 'Your fallow decrees nurtured olive branches...' The prince's Adam's apple moved like a parched ditch, '...that bore petrified fruit.'\n\nThe dying king clawed wheat-carved armrests, extracting land deeds tangled with Golden Fleece medals—the wine stains were blood fingerprints he'd pressed for French warhorses. Ancient weed seeds shook loose, clinging to Miguel's boot mud. 'Land is a thorny swaddle,' he gasped, stuffing torn parchment into the youth's bloody grip, '...its keepers...pierced by new sprouts...'\n\nThunder split granaries outside, fulfilling astrologers' 'golden blades' prophecy. As [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s pupils dimmed, he saw Miguel lift the dented iron crown—its obsidian like his wife's dried birthing herbs. 'Sow oaths tougher than iron laws,' his falling hand stirred deed ashes, 'let our famine...feed Iberian soil...'\n\nRebel stomping shook rafters as Miguel stood. The swirling ashes now reflected starlight in his eyes—each fragment a vision of harvests yet to come."
DD_ARA_farmer_disaster.6.a: "'All abundance is famine's shadow.'"

DD_ARA_muslim_disaster.1.t: "All That Was Taken"
DD_ARA_muslim_disaster.1.d: "Three years after Aragon's golden lion banner was raised over Granada's battlements, Hassan ibn Jalal—stripped of his 'Imam' title—huddled in a Toledo Jewish quarter attic. The scholar who once compiled lunar calendars for the Nasrids now survived by copying Christian indulgences. His instinctive Arabic flourishes on freshly inked parchments were always crudely crossed out with Latin crosses.\n\nThe fuse of rebellion lit at Seville's converted mosque baptismal font. When workers chiseled away the last Kufic inscription, black rose-scented water surged from hidden conduits, eroding the new Virgin Mary carving into tearstains. Hassan picked up a shattered Quran podium fragment from the crowd, its edges sticky with unconsecrated chrism.\n\nSeven days later, twenty-three conversos were found dead in abandoned Arab baths. Their slit-throated bodies formed a star pattern, each clutching bloody Latin Bible pages. As Inquisition friars arrived with torches, Hassan knelt in the steam room corner, tracing sulfur stains into a Sufi poet's century-old satire.\n\n'Truth on pyres becomes doubly heavy ash.' He recited his own calendar verses at trial, his shackles scraping stone so loudly the scribe misspelled a word. When the brand seared his crescent moon tattoo, seven bell tolls echoed from the dungeon depths."

DD_ARA_muslim_disaster.2.t: "The New Sprout"
DD_ARA_muslim_disaster.2.d: "On the seventh day of Hassan's imprisonment in Barcelona's dungeon, guards found him scratching astronomical tables into moldy walls. The crooked Arabic numerals interwoven with Christian feast days precisely predicted that night's lunar eclipse. When moonlight leaked through the narrow window, his shackles' shadow resembled a broken crescent moon.\n\nThe trial was set for Christmas Mass. As the prison cart passed a converted mosque-church in Seville, a converted baker threw saffron-laced communion wafers into the cage. Hassan broke one open, revealing honey-coated prayers—the golden syrup dripping between his fingers formed constellations on the cobblestones.\n\nThe execution's miracle came as the noose tightened. A confiscated rebel map spontaneously combusted in the executioner's robe, its ashes revealing an ancient aqueduct drawn in olive oil. This long-dry channel suddenly gushed water, softening the frozen earth beneath the gallows and freeing Hassan. First a Jewish doctor knelt, then converted women in headscarves, finally even halberdiers crossing themselves. The inquisitor postponed the execution, sentencing Hassan instead to monastic scriptorium confinement.\n\nNow Hassan's cell overflows with illuminated parchments—gold-edged Torah fragments from rabbis, Quranic verses pressed with rosewater by Granadan imams. His trilingual manuscripts (Hebrew transliterations, Latin glosses, and Arabic illuminations) circulate secretly in border markets, often bought as interfaith arbitration documents. One matins, guards found the scholar eternally asleep over his unfinished Peace Calendar, his left hand on the manuscript, his right finger pointing to a leap year calculation—the margin bearing a tiny gallows sketch, beneath which grew a triple-leafed olive sapling."

DD_ARA_muslim_disaster.7.t: "Belated Prophecy"
DD_ARA_muslim_disaster.7.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s chest was pierced by a pagan spear, his blood seeping through the dark silver armor to merge with Granada's mosque tile pomegranate patterns. Rebel torches melted Santa María's stained glass into liquid rainbows—the Virgin's shattered eyes reflecting his final irony: the Moorish nobles he'd once placated with Arabic proverbs now trampled crucifixes into mud, shouting ancient war cries of crescent moons and cypress boughs.\n\nMiguel's sword gleamed with pagan priest's bone dust, the olive sprigs in his mail long scorched brown. As he knelt, [Root.Monarch.GetName] smelled incense and sulfur in his hair—the same deadly mix as his Gascon queen's birthing herbs twenty years prior. 'The peace you bought with Song of Songs...' The prince's voice rasped like an emptying hourglass, '...couldn't withstand the fire foretold in star charts.'\n\nThe dying king pulled an Arabic amulet tangled with rosary beads from his breastplate—its Cordoban geometric patterns, secretly taken from a Moorish scholar in youth and passed off as saintly relics. Obsidian powder leaked from its cracks toward the ruined crucifix's shadow. 'Faith is poisoned honey,' he gasped, pressing the bloody chain into Miguel's palm, 'its drinkers...must shatter the holy grail...'\n\nA meteor streaked outside, perfectly matching the 'Two-Faced Janus' prophecy. As [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s pupils dimmed, he saw Miguel lift a broken crusader sword—its emerald pommel like his wife's dried blood on swaddling clothes. 'Kindle fires brighter than the sun,' his falling hand stirred ashes, 'let our remorse...become Iberia's flint...'\n\nPagan cheers drowned prayers as Miguel stood. The amulet's chain shattered, its golden beads rolling across bloodied tiles—each reflecting starlight in his eyes."

DD_ARA_knight_disaster.1.t: "The Maimed Roar"
DD_ARA_knight_disaster.1.d: "As dawn frost crept along Almería's battlements, Benat was flattening his last silver-plated pauldron with a broken sword. The morning dew-soaked muster roll curled at his feet, Aragon's wax seal crumbling into crimson tears in the mud.\n\n'They call this peace.' He hurled the twisted metal into the moat, startling night herons from the reeds. 'Minting coins from our blades, decorating triumphs with our scars.'\n\nFive hundred veterans sharpened weapons in the fortress shadows—men who had blocked Berber cavalry with their bodies at Santa Catarina Pass, now dividing moldy rye bread with notched blades. Faded fleur-de-lis banners became bandages for festering stumps, while promised pensions rusted in Valencia's vaults.\n\nThe monastery cellar echoed with muffled clangs of metalwork. Benat ran fingers along his scarred sword, its edge reflecting his sunken left eye. The hanged scout captain had been right—the Church was secretly forging new breastplates with silver meant for widows.\n\n'Tell the king this.' He seized a wine-drinking messenger boy, calloused fingers bruising collarbone. 'Those who'd quell fury must first ready scales to weigh their promises.'\n\nWhen the first flaming arrow ignited council chamber drapes, townsfolk saw not rebels but ragged beggars. Beneath rusted mail surged resentment sharper than Moorish scimitars—these men knew every crack in the walls they'd once held against battering rams.\n\nAs the commander choked on his own golden tassels from the tower, he finally recognized the rioters: Third Pike Regiment, Fifth Slinger Company, Ninth Sappers Battalion... All names meant for memorial stones, now roaring through burning streets."
DD_ARA_knight_disaster.1.a: "The strife never ends!"

DD_ARA_knight_disaster.2.t: "The Unfinished Pact"
DD_ARA_knight_disaster.2.d: "When Pyrenean snowmelt dyed wild roses crimson, Benat's broken sword finally pierced his own oath. On the seventh night of flight, he stumbled by a frozen stream—his silvered pauldron, once used to inspire troops, tumbling from his pack. The twisted metal reflected his sunken left eye and swirling snowflakes in the moonlight.\n\nThree days prior at Pamplona Pass, the parliament sent not knights but twenty oxcarts of wheat and wine. Oak barrels of silver coins were deliberately cracked open, their jingling echoing through the canyon like a lethal lullaby. Benat watched his most loyal lieutenant's Adam's apple bob as soldiers who'd shared rat meat in trenches now speared moldy bread onto campfires with their pikes.\n\nHoofbeats kept fading into the mist during his escape. When his last three followers stole the packhorses, Benat found the casualty list sewn into his cloak lining had been torn to shreds by mountain winds. Names once roused with promises of 'vineyards and freedom' now melted as snowflakes on his chapped lips.\n\nThe fatal misstep came on a basalt slope. As his nails clawed at iron-rich red gravel, he hallucinated the sunset at Santa Catarina Pass—the blood-soaked banner now hanging in parliament's hall.\n\nShepherds found his frozen corpse under ice three days later. His rusted mail held a half-burned land grant, its edges still bearing bloodied handprints from his men. The king's men took his sword but left the frozen wheat seeds to sprout in spring snow.\n\nSurviving rebels received silver-edged pardons by Easter morn. As they lined up for copper coins outside city hall, none noticed meltwater seeping into arrowheads embedded during the revolt—now oxidizing green in crevices.\n\nA modest mass was held for fallen commanders. Pardoned veterans shared palm-shaped cracked bread outside, while myrrh and frankincense from choirboys' censers masked older scents of iron.\n\nPyrenean snowmelt continued south, erasing shallow claw marks on cliffs. Only one scribe noticed the newest Iberian map bore a tiny grapevine near Almería Fortress—painted with faded blood."

DD_ARA_knight_disaster.6.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s silver armor was pierced by once-loyal halberds, his blood snaking across gilded tiles in shattered fleur-de-lis patterns. Knights' torches melted the bronze crest above the council chamber into liquid twilight—lords he'd personally dubbed with golden spurs now wrapped bloodied sword hilts in tournament banners, singing twisted refrains from the Song of Roland.\n\nMiguel's cloak sparkled with armor fragments, his gauntlet ribbons trampled into mud. As he leaned down, [Root.Monarch.GetName] saw in his son's pauldron reflection the Gascon princess's death-grip on linen swaddling—its pallor mirroring torn peace treaties. 'The falcons you bred with tournament cheers...' The prince traced the dented lion emblem on his father's breastplate, '...have pecked out their trainer's eyes.'\n\nThe dying king's breath rasped like rusted gears. Bloodied fingers pried loose a broken sword hilt tangled with the Order of Saint George—its crossguard bore the tournament crest from when he'd shattered vows to appease lords. Grayish rust seeped from the blade, staining Miguel's golden tassels. 'Glory is a quenched cage,' he gasped, pressing the hilt into the youth's palm, 'its breaker...must forge new shackles...'\n\nA warhorse's scream outside aligned perfectly with astrologers' 'Iron Crown Falls' prophecy. As [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s pupils dimmed, he watched Miguel lift the dented crown—its ruby like his wife's birthing blood. 'Forge power colder than wrought iron,' his falling hand scattered armor shards, 'let our oaths...become Iberia's anvil...'\n\nKnights' roars drowned the organ's last notes. When Miguel stood, the broken hilt vibrated—its iron flakes catching starlight hidden in his eyes."

Under the cold-blooded Rodrigo III, it adopted rigid policies of absolute monarchical centralization, forcing its Moorish subjects to either convert or face death. The kingdom's power was concentrated in the king's hands, and his will was unquestionable.\n\nUnfortunately, his successor - the Mad King Diego - plunged the kingdom back into the abyss. The first half of his reign was spent indulging in pleasures while neglecting governance, and the latter half was consumed by madness and delusions. The temperamental king essentially never attended to state affairs. During his prolonged rule, the kingdom sank into corruption and decline. Though the Cyrenaican legions perpetually guarded the frontiers, the Sultan of Egypt and the kingdom's Crusader brethren in the Holy Land never ceased coveting Africa.\n\nNow that we directly control these lands, it is time to choose our future governance strategy."

After the disastrous defeat at Manzikert, a desperate Alexios I had no choice but to seek help from his Catholic brethren. The answering Crusaders capitalized on the chaos following Malik-Shah I's death, capturing Edessa and Antioch. To the south, the dying Fatimid Caliphate stood no chance against the Frankish armies, while the fractured Seljuks could only focus on Anatolia. Thus four Crusader States were founded upon Muslim ruins - the County of Edessa, County of Tripoli, Principality of Antioch, and Kingdom of Jerusalem.\n\nBut this golden age was short-lived. The legendary Saladin rose from Egypt, overthrew the incompetent Fatimids, and launched a ferocious counterattack. Under the reckless command of Templar Grand Master Gérard, the Crusader forces were nearly annihilated at Hattin. Edessa fell, northern Crusader territories shrank, and Muslims even temporarily reclaimed Jerusalem. After Saladin's death, his descendants fought bitterly over his Near Eastern legacy, allowing the Crusaders to seize Egypt - only to lose it again to Ayyubid successors.\n\nIn 1228, Frederick II, grandson of Barbarossa and heir to Jerusalem's throne, arrived in the Holy Land. Backed by the Pope, this emperor ended Jerusalem's succession crisis and assumed the honor of Protector of the Holy Sepulchre. Allied with Egyptian Sultan al-Kamil, he crushed his eastern brothers, captured Damascus, and ultimately ended decades of religious war through the controversial Treaty of Jaffa - sealed by an unprecedented interfaith marriage."

DD_ARA.36.t: "The Decisive Moment"
DD_ARA.36.d: "The Papal States, the sacred rulers of the temporal world, are not as inviolable as they appear. In truth, whenever His Holiness faces invasion, his first instinct has always been to seek protection from others. The Papacy has relied on Byzantium and the Franks, extracting benefits while granting them legitimacy and recognition in return.\n\nNow we have become the Papal States' new partner. As masters of Italy, should we further strengthen the Holy See's sacred status to secure the bishops' support, or should we modestly encroach upon the Pope's privileges - after all, his current position exists solely by our grace?"
DD_ARA.36.a: "From this day forward, I still wish to walk with His Holiness."

DD_ARA.37.t: "Monopoly Mandate"
DD_ARA.37.d: "While our dominance over the New World is indisputable, certain other Catholic nations continue to oppose our sacred colonial endeavors. Thus, our bishops have secured a new Papal Bull from His Holiness. Under this decree, all New World territories and riches shall belong to us alone, and no Roman Catholic nation may conduct colonization or exploration activities.\n\nThough some nations may grumble, what can they truly say? For it is we who walk with the Holy Father."

DD_ARA.38.t: "The Unknown Route"
DD_ARA.38.d: "A distinguished navigator, da Gama, has recently approached our court. He claims the sea route to Asia remains unexploited - with sufficient ships and resources, he could open the passage to India and bring countless spices and silks to our realm.\n\nThough our nobility remains skeptical about seeking India to the east, this young mariner persistently petitions the Emperor with unwavering determination. Perhaps we should seriously consider his proposal."
DD_ARA.38.a: "We happen to have some resources to spare."
DD_ARA.38.a.t: "Da Gama begins his voyage; every three months we'll receive updates on the fleet's progress."
DD_ARA.38.b: "Let's not bother."
DD_ARA.38.b.t: "\nMight as well... renovate the Alhambra Palace instead.\n"

DD_ARA.39.t: "Day One: Embarking"
DD_ARA.39.d: "Amidst the harbor's farewell fanfare, da Gama - by command of our glorious Emperor - set sail from Lisbon with four small vessels bearing over 140 crewmen, beginning the eastward voyage. The ships soon reached islands we had previously explored, and after brief respite, pressed onward into the unknown."
DD_ARA.39.a: "An auspicious beginning."

DD_ARA.40.t: "Day Two: West African Coast"
DD_ARA.40.d: "Our crew soon reached the West African coast, where locals spoke of a once-mighty Islamic empire stretching from southern rainforests to the Sahara Desert in the north, from Atlantic shores to Hausa territories in the east - a vast realm rich in resources, producing abundant gold.\n\nWhile our sailors showed little interest in other legends, they grew particularly excited at the final detail: gold!"
DD_ARA.40.a: "These riches should belong to us."

DD_ARA.41.t: "Day Three: Bantu Kingdoms"
DD_ARA.41.d: "As our fleet continued southward along the coast, we encountered a remarkable civilization. Though initially wary of strangers, these native people proved exceptionally friendly. Through their introduction, we were granted audience with their Bantu king. After laborious communication, he expressed keen interest in establishing trade - including exchanges of human chattel.\n\nWith our Indian mission paramount, we politely declined most gifts while maintaining cordial relations. These connections will surely prove valuable in time."
DD_ARA.41.a: "May all future kings prove so accommodating..."
DD_ARA.41.a_buff: "Kongo Commerce"

DD_ARA.42.t: "Day Four: Eye of the Storm"
DD_ARA.42.d: "After nearly four months and over 4,500 nautical miles, the fleet reached the charted Bay of Saint Helena - only to find not tranquility, but a terrifying tempest! Yet on Christmas Eve, our brave crew finally rounded the Cape of Good Hope, sailing into the African coast of the western Indian Ocean."
DD_ARA.42.a: "A narrow escape."

DD_ARA.43.t: "Day Five: Lost Contact"
DD_ARA.43.d: "Though they survived the storm, new troubles emerged; on the scheduled reporting date, da Gama's fleet sent no messages, vanishing completely without trace. All we can do now is offer our most devout prayers."
DD_ARA.43.a: "Most troubling..."

DD_ARA.44.t: "Day Six: Contact Regained"
DD_ARA.44.d: "At last, we've reestablished contact with the fleet!\n\nAfter entering the uncharted waters of East Africa's coast, they docked at the port of Mombasa to resupply. To their surprise, the local inhabitants were Muslims, and relations rapidly deteriorated to the brink of armed conflict. Wisely recognizing both his mission's importance and our forces' weakness, da Gama avoided prolonged engagement.\n\nAfter evading hastily assembled Muslim vessels, they sailed north to replenish at Malindi - Mombasa's rival city. Catching the seasonal southwest monsoon winds available only in the first half of the year, da Gama's fleet made directly for India's coast, finally reaching Calicut, the most powerful port city on India's southwestern shore.\n\nFor the first time since the Middle Ages, Western European ships have reached these fabled lands."
DD_ARA.44.a: "Both terrifying and exhilarating!"
DD_ARA.44.a_buff: "Indian Wealth"

DD_ARA.45.t: "Day Seven: Pressing Forward"
DD_ARA.45.d: "Having established our foothold in India, da Gama devised new sailing plans. Local merchants spoke of legendary Cathay lying not far to the east, while to the south awaited humid treasure lands with countless unexplored islands. Driven by thirst for riches, our energetic crew grew eager to push eastward into unknown realms.\n\nThe question remains - shall we turn north or south?"
DD_ARA.45.a: "Northward - toward more advanced civilizations."
DD_ARA.45.b: "Southward - toward greater unknowns."

DD_ARA.46.t: "Against the Current"
DD_ARA.46.d: "To our surprise, the Chinese rulers proved exceedingly wary. When we followed our usual practice of requesting temporary anchorage, the discourteous locals violently drove us away, wounding several of our crewmen. With no alternative, our fleet must press onward, hoping to find more hospitable rulers in our future ports of call."
DD_ARA.46.a: "Well, we hadn't expected such... cautious hosts."

DD_ARA.47.t: "Land of the Rising Sun"
DD_ARA.47.d: "Just as we prepared to abandon hope, islands suddenly appeared on the horizon - then more land beyond. Here we replenished our dwindling supplies and found proper rest. The natives claimed this was the easternmost world.\n\nThough we sought to establish an outpost, the locals were embroiled in inter-village warfare, their constant fighting forcing us to continue northward."
DD_ARA.47.a: "The journey wasn't wasted."

DD_ARA.48.t: "World's End"
DD_ARA.48.d: "At last we reached this continent's terminus, encountering the diminutive natives of its islands. After negotiations with their rulers, they permitted our settlement here - the first exchange between our nations.\n\nBut we know well: all kindness shown to these unenlightened heathens is but prelude to conquest."
DD_ARA.48.a: "A new era of crusading begins here!"
DD_ARA.48.a_buff: "Eastern Trade Route"

DD_ARA.49.t: "Terra Australis"
DD_ARA.49.d: "Just as we prepared to abandon hope, islands suddenly appeared on the horizon - then more land beyond. The natives differed markedly from any we'd encountered, their civilization seemingly still in primitive stages. Yet the land proved rich in resources, which we plundered extensively, solving our supply shortages completely. Still, the environment remained thoroughly inhospitable - best we continue southward."
DD_ARA.49.a: "An excellent place to exile criminals."

DD_ARA.50.t: "World's End"
DD_ARA.50.d: "At last we reached this continent's terminus, encountering the rather diminutive natives of its islands. After negotiations with their rulers, they permitted our settlement here - the first exchange between our nations.\n\nBut we know well that for these heathens untouched by enlightenment, any kindness or smile merely masks impending plunder."
DD_ARA.50.a: "Such vast oceans await our conquest!"

DD_ARA.51.t: "The Fallen Tower"
DD_ARA.51.d: "Constantinople - heart of the Eastern Roman Empire, the City the World Once Desired - now lies in our grasp. As our imperial troops marched through her mighty walls, they realized they weren't the first conquerors to tread these stones.\n\nTraces of ancient Rome remain remarkably preserved throughout the city: perhaps in the cobbled roads beneath our feet, or the distant glow of palaces. Yet every visitor understands that Rome's immortal name carries equally her countless trials.\n\nShould we study and adopt these Roman legacies? Or go further - proclaim an imperial rebirth?"
DD_ARA.51.a: "We shan't repeat Diocletian's mistakes."

Sicilians took to the streets, assaulting imperial troops and officials in chaotic rebellion.\n\nWe couldn't miss this golden opportunity.

DD_ARA.58_shijianqianzhanwenben: "This event celebrates our successful conquest of Sicily."

DD_ARA.59.t: "Prelude to War"
DD_ARA.59.d: "What constitutes defense? The parrying of blows. What characterizes defense? Awaiting the strike. Military action bearing this characteristic is defensive action, and only through this lens can defense be distinguished from offense in war. Yet pure defense contradicts war's very nature - all defensive postures must ultimately be relative.\n\nThus this awaiting characteristic applies to defense in its totality, not its individual components. When we await the enemy's assault in battle, it becomes defensive combat; when we await their advance to our positions in engagement, defensive battle; when we await their incursion into our theater, defensive campaign.\n\nIn each case, the awaiting/parrying nature remains fundamentally defensive without contradicting war's essence, as we benefit from enemies charging our bayonets or assaulting our fortifications. But to truly wage war, we must counterattack - offensive actions conducted within defensive frameworks, confined to our positions or theaters. Thus defensive campaigns permit offensives; defensive battles employ attacking divisions; troops awaiting charges may still counter with offensive fire. Defense is never merely a shield, but a shield composed of cunning strikes."

DD_ARA.79.d: "As Aragon's golden fleet cleaves through the emerald waves of the Mediterranean, every cresting wave blossoms with the glorious crowns forged by the Peninsular faction. The prestige of the Seven Seas' sovereign, carried by pomegranate petals falling from Santa Maria's deck, dyes crimson every tide from Gibraltar to Cyprus. On parliamentary parchments, freshly inked treaties meander like conquerors' wake, stringing shattered city-states and islands into pearl-encrusted scepters draped around the Virgin's merciful neck.\n\nNew World mists still linger as Aragon's cross-emblazoned sails sweep the horizon like white eagles. Colonists' boots shatter Aztec temple drums, melting the Inca's golden sun into figureheads' eternal smiles; the Mayan prophecy of 'Quetzalcoatl's bloody return' ultimately becomes consecration wine for the Peninsular Council amidst Castilian gunpowder. During San Juan festivities, Potosí's mercury and Río de la Plata's silver flow across royal vaults like the Milky Way, while Madrid's poets redraw the zodiac with conquerors' names - proclaiming each gold fleck God's stardust for the new Eden.\n\nWhen eastern monsoons swell Aragon's sails, Ceylon's cinnamon and Malacca's cloves pile high as pagan altars on stern decks. Zheng He's star charts are reassembled, compass needles pointing beyond the Promised Land: Latin inscriptions grace Ryukyu's coral reefs, while Nagasaki's cherry blossoms echo the Song of Songs. Macau's lighthouse flames embrace Barcelona's sacred fires along the meridian, stitching the earth into a perfect golden ring on the double-headed eagle's crest.\n\nNow ancestral kings' spirits stand upon Hercules' Pillars, witnessing the colossal tree nourished by their bloodline - roots entwining three continents, branches hung with tidal charts and monsoon compasses, its crown ablaze with light forged from seven seas' submission: Aragon's golden epilogue to human history, inscribed with iron and poetry, blood and stars."

Yet every visitor knows Rome's immortal name carries the weight of all her trials.\n\nBut even the greatest history fades with the wind. For now, the victory is ours."

DD_ARA.77.t: "Cradle of Steel"
DD_ARA.77.d: "When Latin heraldry brands Aragon's eagle banners, the Pyrenees' snowpeaks become a silver flood sweeping Europe. Notre-Dame's stained glass depicts Charlemagne's coronation blessing new empire-builders: his iron cavalry crushes Seine's morning dew, making Aragon's pomegranate roots crack French parliamentary stones. Vatican's bronze bells tremble for Latin triumph, as papal scarlet dissolves like maple leaves beneath Lyon's walls, while Cologne Cathedral's spire becomes the seventh thorn on our crown.\n\nThe Holy Roman dream still lingers when Aragon's armored infantry - a dark tide - drowns Danube's amber moonlight. Nuremberg's forges sound conquest's knell; the double-headed eagle breaks wings in Alpine passes. Venice's Doge traces trembling fingers across parchment, finding the Adriatic now gilds Aragon's military sash. Charlemagne's fractured laws are reforged on Latin anvils - from Provence's lavender fields to Prussia's fir forests, every inch of land bleeds hybrid glory of Justinian Code and Song of Roland. In the imperial diet, conquered swords form crosses, all hilts pointing to Madrid's sundial.\n\nAs English fog retreats from Calais, Aragon's dragon banners plant on Scotland's basalt thrones. Tower ravens clutch Plantagenet feathers, watching Latin chariots grind across Yorkshire cobblestones; on Moscow's tundra, the Tsar's sable cloak shreds into confessional ribbons for Iberian saints. Brandenburg Gate's statues bow to crown Aragon's ruler - that diadem of Byzantine amethysts and Germanic iron now reflects the same blood moon from Gibraltar to Urals.\n\nNow Charlemagne's ghost watches from Aachen's dome, witnessing his unfinished epic continued in Latin steel - Aragon's domain is chainmail woven vast, each link imprisoning a defeated crown, the mesh stiff with jurisprudence and spears, sacramental wine and swords, forging Europe into one coronation ode."
