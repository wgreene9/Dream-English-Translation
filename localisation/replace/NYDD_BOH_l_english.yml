 DD_BOH_1_t: "On the Brink of Collapse"
 DD_BOH_1_d: "Although the reign of Wenceslaus V was extremely unpopular, it must be acknowledged that he did one thing well in his lifetime—centralizing power in the hands of the king. After his death at the hands of a Hussite assassin, the empty throne of Bohemia signified a power vacuum, heralding the beginning of a chaotic era of anarchy.\n\nThe long-suppressed nobles quickly formed a provisional committee to take over the government, but these restless profiteers fought among themselves, vying to carve up Wenceslaus's legacy, with little concern for restoring the kingdom's stability. Jeanne d'Arc, the war hero beloved for defending Catholic believers and the Governor of Luthenia, was deeply suspicious of these nobles. She entrusted her territory to her deputy and old comrade, General Jan Žižka, and marched her army to Prague to oversee the committee's efforts to stabilize the chaos.\n\nBeyond the many families within Bohemia eyeing the throne, the Prince of Nitra in distant Hungary also laid claim to the Bohemian crown. The ambitious prince had not forgotten his noble Luxembourg bloodline, and behind him stood the Kingdom of Hungary, unwilling to accept its defeat half a century ago. The storm of turmoil has enveloped Bohemia, and no matter what decision Prague makes about its fate, a new civil war is undoubtedly inevitable."
 DD_BOH_1a: "Let us support the leader of the nobles, Poděbrady."
 DD_BOH_1b: "The Prince of Nitra holds a legitimate claim to the Bohemian throne."
 DD_BOH_1c: "Only the holy heroine Joan can lead the people of Bohemia!"
