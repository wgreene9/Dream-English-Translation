 DD_BOH_1_t: "On the Brink of Collapse"
 DD_BOH_1_d: "Although the reign of Wenceslaus V was extremely unpopular, it must be acknowledged that he did one thing well in his lifetime—centralizing power in the hands of the king. After his death at the hands of a Hussite assassin, the empty throne of Bohemia signified a power vacuum, heralding the beginning of a chaotic era of anarchy.\n\nThe long-suppressed nobles quickly formed a provisional committee to take over the government, but these restless profiteers fought among themselves, vying to carve up Wenceslaus's legacy, with little concern for restoring the kingdom's stability. Jeanne d'Arc, the war hero beloved for defending Catholic believers and the Governor of Luthenia, was deeply suspicious of these nobles. She entrusted her territory to her deputy and old comrade, General Jan Žižka, and marched her army to Prague to oversee the committee's efforts to stabilize the chaos.\n\nBeyond the many families within Bohemia eyeing the throne, the Prince of Nitra in distant Hungary also laid claim to the Bohemian crown. The ambitious prince had not forgotten his noble Luxembourg bloodline, and behind him stood the Kingdom of Hungary, unwilling to accept its defeat half a century ago. The storm of turmoil has enveloped Bohemia, and no matter what decision Prague makes about its fate, a new civil war is undoubtedly inevitable."

A grand council led by senior Bohemian nobles will elect a competent leader worthy of the crown to guide our people, utterly destroy the sinister Germanization agenda, unite the West Slavic peoples, and rebuild the glory of Great Moravia.§!\n"
DD_BOH_1b_tt: "§O By the beautiful blue Danube, the glorious Luxembourg dynasty leads us toward greatness. By pressing our legitimate claim to Hungary, we shall unite the inheritance of John I—the flourishing crownlands of the dynasty—merging them into the noble and imperial blood of the House of Luxembourg, becoming part of the German lineage. A legendary and ancient empire shall rise from the ruins...§!\n"
DD_BOH_1c_tt: "§J The sacred heroine Joan, the pure and holy daughter of the Church, messenger of the Archangel Michael! Woe unto the rampant villains, the wicked heretics, the devils who burn, kill, plunder, and defile God's name. Under the leadership of the Maid of France, we shall surely strike hard against heretics and pagans, driving out the nefarious criminals from our homeland without exception. This will undoubtedly become the most magnificent, greatest epic in Christian history, the most sacred and successful holy war, will it not?§!\n"

DD_BOH_5_d: "The carriage wheels turned relentlessly, creaking and groaning, mingling with the clatter of knights' steel armor. Inside the carriage, the richly clad Maiden sat in perfect stillness, like a statue. A deathly silence pervaded the procession bound for Orléans, accompanying them through the German lands. The Bohemian farce had reached its end. France's hero was finally returning to France—under Bohemia's protection.\n\nThe procession's destination was an iron-grey monastery. Guards bearing longswords pulled open the gates; the dark corridor within yawned like a great beast, swallowing the Maiden into its depths. No spring breezes from her homeland, no wildflowers from her native soil, no familiar, brave, or gallant knights. All that remained for the Maiden was a prison engraved with scripture, an exquisite gilded cage for a canary. A Bible, a garden of plants and flowers, a quill—this was the entirety of the years that lay ahead of her. The girl with radiant golden hair and a blossom-like smile had died in Bohemia, along with her ideals.\n\nOn the desk, a flickering candle illuminated a letter left unfinished and cast aside. The hastily scrawled "à mon amour" at the top had been vigorously crossed out. On another sheet of pristine paper, elegant and neat handwriting stated—"
DD_BOH_5a: "\"My dear Gilles...\""

DD_BOH_6_t: "Journey Home"
DD_BOH_6_d: "The aged nun wandered along the lonely country dirt road.\nFlying snowflakes settled on the horse's mane, like those long-lost dreams of yesteryears, melting into the muddy yellow earth with each metallic clop of hooves.\nTo the right of the long road lay Prague's bustling streets and alleys, vivid as a dream.\nTo the left stretched the familiar, nostalgic field ridges of her homeland.\nThough her hands were withered and trembling, they still firmly clutched the dreams and setbacks she had once tread step by step.\nThe sound of carriage wheels grinding over ruts echoed like a traveler's lament.\nIdeals, oh ideals. How many mistakes had she made for them, what price had she paid?\nThe old woman muttered to herself.\nTo the right of the road lay elusive ideals.\nTo the left of the road lay simple, direct happiness.\nThe nun stared blankly into the carriage, at the empty seat opposite, gazing through the window at the driver's blurred back, as if watching sunlight silently sweep across this brief lifetime.\nIt seemed as if a young, naive girl sat there, her face still bearing the rustic simplicity of a village maiden, one arm tightly clutching a thick Bible, the other propping up her pale, tender cheek, secretly peeking out the window at the knight.\nIn the hazy sunlight, a young and valiant knight seemed to sit upright on his horse, his fleur-de-lis-emblazoned armor gleaming silver, his face indistinct. Only occasionally did it appear that the knight stole a glance, smiling toward the girl.\nThe dream ended as the carriage gently halted before her hometown church. The nun laboriously stepped down, gazing at the short spire of the village chapel, listening as the worship bells rang out, softly echoing across the fields of Orléans."
DD_BOH_6a: "Jeanne d'Arc gently closed her eyes, this time never to open them again."

DD_BOH_7_t: "Ideals and Happiness"
DD_BOH_7_d: "To my dear comrade Jeanne,\n\nIt has been so long since we parted in Prague, yet your face has never faded in my mind. The battles we fought together remain precious memories, treasures I shall forever cherish. War left us not with glory, but only weariness and torment. Jeanne, please permit me to address you so, just as you once asked me to in the camp. I understand the conflict raging in your heart, even as we fought for God's righteous cause and for the faithful left homeless.\n\nTherefore, Jeanne. Allow me this boldness—I beg you, I implore you to lay down the burdens that place you in this purgatory of controversy, to abandon the sins of Bohemia that make you toss through sleepless nights and weep alone behind campfires. Return to our homeland. You must remember the countryside estate I told you about—that joyful, tranquil, beautiful place. There are blooming flower fields, people living in peace, and picturesque countryside.\n\nPlease forgive my selfishness and hypocrisy. You must see that my feelings for you transcend mere comradeship, becoming fervent, irresistible love. I know how selfish, base, and greedy my heart must appear before your sacred devotion to Christ. Yet I cannot stand by, watching nightmares torment you every night, watching you question whether you walk the righteous path.\n\nJeanne, my noble star, my lily-pure and exalted comrade. I witness daily how your own noble virtue tortures you, forcing you to become Michael's messenger. But to me, Jeanne, you are first a beautiful and kindhearted girl who shouldn't have to bear such burdens or question every step you take. Come away with me! You deserve a life of your own, the happiness owed to every young woman."
DD_BOH_7a: "—Your loyal knight, Gilles."

DD_BOH_8_t: "Integrating the Luxembourg Crowns"
DD_BOH_8_d: "The House of Luxembourg, originating from the Low Countries, was once an obscure minor lineage until John of Luxembourg acquired the Crown of Bohemia. His father Henry's unwavering support for the Emperor during the Great Imperial Rebellion secured this prize, and thus the Luxembourg coat of arms replaced that of the rebellious Premyslids. The dynasty reached its zenith when John's grandson, Sigismund, married Mary, daughter of Louis I, and inherited the Kingdom of Hungary.\n\nNow, the fragmented crownlands of the House of Luxembourg are finally reunited under our branch. Our glorious bloodline shall unite once more, becoming the cornerstone of our great empire. These crownlands rightfully belonging to our house will be thoroughly integrated; the kingdoms once ruled by different branches of the Luxembourg line shall bow to the sole authority of Prague. The rule of the House of Luxembourg knows no bounds."

Their king, Sigismund of the House of Luxembourg, and his rabid Taborite hyenas ultimately fell before the banners of the Czechs and God, never setting foot on our soil again for the rest of his days.\n\nNow the tables have turned. The lands of the Magyars lie beneath our feet, and it is time to return the fear and chaos they brought upon us to these bandits and marauders. The rule of the House of Luxembourg has been destroyed, Hungary has become our plaything, and this land shall become a home where Bohemians can live in peace and prosperity. These savage Magyars will have no choice but to submit."

DD_BOH_10_t: "Taking Over Silesia"
DD_BOH_10_d: "With the collapse of the Taborite Hussite government in Silesia, a new question lies before us—what should we do with this land? The former lord of Silesia, the reckless and arrogant Count of Silesia, sided with the Taborite rebels during the Hussite Wars and was struck down by the Holy Maiden of France, Jeanne d'Arc. His territory was split in two, with the north guarded by the Margrave of Lusatia and the south occupied by remaining Hussite factions.\n\nAfter years of Taborite influence, the corruption they left in southern Silesia runs deeper than we imagined. Hussite influence has penetrated deep into Silesia's countryside, local order is in disarray, with bandits taking advantage of the chaos and stubborn heretics emerging endlessly. The peasants, already suffering from the war, are miserable, many even turning to banditry. Perhaps we should let the northern Margrave establish a military government to manage here, or, let the Utraquists of Prague, followers of Jan Hus who advocate for moderate church reform, persuade the local remnants?"

If even someone like him believed the Roman Catholic Church was the right choice, could they truly have been wrong? Once the seeds of doubt were sown, they spread wildly among the Taborites. In the end, the people had to see the error of their ways and return to the fold."
DD_BOH_11_d: "After persuasion by senior Utraquists (they even held a debate assembly), the Taborites remained convinced that even if Jan Hus knew the truth, he was still mistaken in its practical application and execution. Clearly, Jan Hus chose the path of compromise, while the excellent, steadfast Taborites remain unshaken. Their dictionary has no word for 'compromise,' so naturally, they would never choose it."
DD_BOH_11a: "So be it."

DD_BOH_12_t: "Government Reorganization"
DD_BOH_12_d: "As our territories expand, our previous governance model for the Czech lands is becoming outdated. Bohemia requires a new political system, a崭新的 kingdom government to manage our increasingly vast nation. The complex multi-ethnic political environment has replaced our former homogeneous Czech situation, necessitating a reconsideration of the status of various peoples under the kingdom's rule.\n\nBy reorganizing the royal government, this presents an excellent opportunity to enforce Prague's authority throughout the kingdom, implement centralization, and grasp the destinies of all peoples in our own hands. Alternatively, we could devolve power to local ethnic authorities, allowing other ethnic groups under Bohemian rule to participate in the government restructuring to achieve long-term stability."

This well-honed iron army had already sharpened their blades, prepared their steeds, with Bohemia's white lion and the solemn Holy Cross banner dancing in the wind. He saw the Military Governor and her adjutant already mounted, while the veteran general Jan Žižka was hoisting the standard.\n\n\"Your Excellency, what... what is happening? Where are we going?\" Karel found the imposing female general, the silver sword at her waist glinting brilliantly in the sunlight. \"This is a surprise attack, Karel,\" the Maiden replied calmly. \"We are going to bring destruction upon those heretical mobs.\" \"Governor, I don't understand,\" the bewildered staff officer felt a chill down his spine. \"Didn't we just sign a peace treaty with the Hussites?\""

The calls for religious reform grow ever louder, with humanists continuously advocating for a move away from divinity and theocracy. Even within the Church, reformist voices that had fallen silent since the reforms of Jan Hus have reemerged, urging us to carry out secular church reforms.\n\nTherefore, the Bohemian Church will undergo a thorough reform. The Archbishop will henceforth be elected by a church council and confirmed by papal investiture, rather than directly appointed as before. The church government will no longer be solely managed by clerical monks, but instead formed through the establishment of an elected Bohemian parliament, with appointments made via committee."

The peace and tranquility have made people forget their duty of religious devotion. Deviant humanists actually cry out for so-called human liberation, denying the necessity of the Church and faith. Various heresies and church reformers are challenging our pure faith, and we must respond.\n\nBohemia must undergo reform. By transforming our dioceses into a militarized knightly combat order, we will establish a government of national unity, rebuilding the spiritual and religious purity throughout Bohemia. We will fight against heresy, we will fight against evil, we will fight against all decay and corruption. We must unite as one, forever following Christ's path, becoming a fortress of faith with national unity, defending the devotion and purity of our spiritual world."

Though initially a temporary strategy, these wagon fortifications tenaciously resisted Hungarian and Cuman cavalry against Sigismund's armies, securing victory for the kingdom.\n\nNow, though Sigismund has passed to the afterlife, Marshal Žižka's Wagenburg tactics remain a valuable asset to our military. We should fully promote these tactics, implementing them throughout our army as an excellent method for countering cavalry and armed levies. Civilian formations composed of wagon forts will effectively withstand cavalry charges and deliver powerful counterattacks using firearms."

Above this basic group, ten wagons form a larger tactical unit, which then scales up to formations of dozens or even hundreds of wagons at the company level. The modified wagons provide soldiers with protection against ranged weapons, while the elevated position and protective plates also effectively deter enemy melee attacks. More importantly, the formed wagon fortifications sufficiently withstand large-scale cavalry charges, ensuring that infantry of common origin with simple equipment won't be terrified into rout. The civilian soldiers will fire crossbows and firearms from inside and outside the wagons to repel enemy forces."

When the first Taborite monk took up his pen and wrote the initial character of that manifesto declaring war upon the world, the silence seemed destined to last forever—until surrender, or until death brought eternal rest. Struggling in silence, accepting that unwilling fate in silence, dancing wildly within the palm of destiny in silence. The fiery blaze at the heart's core burns recklessly, crackling, until it consumes itself to ashes.\n\nEmbers of fervor lie scattered in all directions, everything seemingly sinking back into familiar silence. Raking through the ashes, turning over the dry, blackened firewood—a wind passes, and the embers glow, flames burning crimson. The schism in the Catholic Church seems to have torn open the iron wall enclosing these ashes, and the murmurs of religious reform once again stir in people's hearts. First as whispered secrets, then as wildfire-like waves—that eternal, unextinguishable spark.\n\nThey say Jan Hus's aspirations were betrayed by the Church; they say Christ's chosen should not submit to the fate imposed by Rome; they say—"

Now, the people of Prague cheer my name, while the people of Silesia curse my surname—is this truly what the holy angels expected of me, expected Jeanne d'Arc to do?"
DD_BOH_26a: "\"Heaven is no longer my destination.\""

DD_BOH_27_t: "Farewell"
DD_BOH_27_d: "Amidst the heavy drumbeats and military music, I watched the Bohemian flag embroidered with the white lion draped over the plain coffin, carried by the crowd toward the cemetery. Marshal Jan Žižka had served his homeland long enough. He was a true Bohemian, a general, a gentle old man. That's why he despised Sigismund, hated those marauding thugs, loathed those who harmed his country.\n\nHe sympathized with, even loved, the Bohemian people, regardless of whether they were Hussite heretics. When I first arrived in Bohemia, it was he and that French knight who strongly supported me, helping me gain the king's trust; he persuaded me to forgive misguided Hussite believers, comforting my lost and struggling soul—Marshal Žižka with his long beard felt like a father to me, I often thought with a smile when the three of us sat around the campfire drinking and talking.\n\nNow, the knight has returned to his homeland, the marshal has been summoned to those lush green pastures, and the only one still walking this long road alone is me."
DD_BOH_27a: "\"The campfire illuminates clearly, yet only my own echo remains knocking at my heart.\""

DD_BOH_28_t: "Soul-Searching"
DD_BOH_28_d: "I sat at my desk, gently stroking the already opened letter in my hand. My sword-calloused fingers made rustling sounds, golden strands of hair falling before my forehead, brushing against my skin, stirring restless itching in my heart. Under the candlelight in the deep night, the already yellowed and creased letter seemed even more aged, the bronze-colored paper suddenly showing traces of moisture-like stains.\n\nWhy? Why did things turn out this way? Why, after all this time, do I still struggle with such weakness? People need a leader who is forever strong, forever resolute, forever devout and holy. In my colleagues' eyes, I'm already a cold-blooded warrior; in the people's eyes, I'm a fervent and sacred saint. But I know this sanctimonious hypocrite is merely an ordinary village woman from Domrémy.\n\nIf only effort brought reward, if only goodness gained recognition, if only piety and nobility received response—why? Why does hoping to save suffering people yield more pain and ugliness? Why does wholeheartedly pursuing ideals result in war and bloodshed? Why is someone who abandoned everything, gave all to ideals and God, tormented day and night by their own conscience?\n\nHelplessness soaks through my bones, corrodes my soul. I cannot save people tormented by war, cannot reclaim lost sheep strayed from faith and path, cannot complete the cause my comrades fought for their entire lives, cannot fulfill the mission God entrusted to me, not even my own life is just swayed by fate. Merciful Lord, just once, if only You would answer me once—"
DD_BOH_28a: "\"What must I do to be worthy of the name 'Saint'?\""

DD_BOH_29_t: "The Answer"
DD_BOH_29_d: "In my unsettled heart, there seems to be a ceaseless voice constantly mocking me. Can a murderous devil like you be called a saint? Can someone despised by thousands call themselves a messenger of angels? Your foolish acts are unforgivable, your callousness despicable. You severed ties with your homeland, abandoned that knight, cast away your own heart—all for that ridiculous ideal?\n\nPerhaps. I am indeed naive and foolish. As the years passed, I gradually felt the once passionate blood and emotions of the past turning into helpless indifference. The first thirty years of my life were spent as a hero admired by all, passing through youth surrounded by flowers and companions; the years thereafter were spent as a leader feared by others, discarding that earnest, throbbing heart of mine, forsaking compassion and all the futures I once dreamed of as a girl.\n\nI heard he would have a blessed marriage under God's grace, a happy family, possessing everything he once promised. Indeed, I cannot wholeheartedly bless him, just as I can never confront my own heart. But I will not regret, for I am the messenger entrusted by God, the saint people expect—I was born thus, and shall remain so.\n\nI hear my own voice echoing calmly within, as the answer to all questioning—"
DD_BOH_29a: "\"Fools and simpletons, saints seek neither respect nor love.\""

DD_BOH_30_t: "Winds of Change"
DD_BOH_30_d: "The Archbishopric of Prague, or the Bohemian Prague Church, rose during the reign of Charles I, who successfully persuaded his teacher Pierre Roger (later Pope Clement VI) to elevate Prague to an archdiocese. Under the influence of the Hussite movement led by Jan Hus, head of the theology department at Prague University, the Bohemian diocese gradually became an independent Catholic church loyal to Rome.\n\nThe Hussite Wars, Protestant Reformation, imperial conflicts with Rome... The Bohemian Church continuously advanced through the tides of time. Our nation has witnessed too much change and turmoil, yet everything seems unchanged. Our clergy are lost in confusion—what is the very foundation we live for? Where are we heading? All this will be decided at the upcoming All-Bohemian Ecclesiastical Council in Prague."
DD_BOH_30a: "Let the stage be set."
DD_BOH_30a_tt: "§YTheocrats§! primarily consist of members from the §Mepiscopal council§! of the independent Bohemian Church. Though called theocrats, these clergy are not traditional fervent missionaries but reformers advocating for church secularization and modernization. Well-educated in theology, they endorse Jan Hus's church reform actions. Influenced by the Reformation, they aim to establish a §Tsecularized§!, §Jhumanist§! church.\n"
DD_BOH_30a_tt2: "§YMilitarists§! largely come from the Bohemian Apostolic §OOrder of Knights§!, mostly from noble classes eager to conquer infidels and heal the Great Schism. Inspired by crusading zeal, they reject external interference in the knightly order and sacred ecclesiastical authority, seeking to control the government to establish a §Rruthless§!, §Rmilitarized§! knightly order.\n"

DD_BOH_31_t: "Prague Congress - Day 1: Legitimacy of Faith"
DD_BOH_31_d: "The Bohemian Order was born from the heroic crusades of the Maiden Joan and subsequently propelled the independent development of the Bohemian Church. Thus, many believe that Bohemia should uphold the creed of the military order, and that non-clerical combatants rightly belong at the church's core; Christ's Church should not merely hold candles for the masses—dispelling darkness is our mission. Yet others argue that those who live by the sword shall die by it, and while we once fought for believers' welfare, the Church itself should not take up arms. The Church should lead in defending faith and upholding purity, not personally take to the battlefield."
DD_BOH_31a: "God's servants must never shed blood—an iron law since the Council of Regensburg."
DD_BOH_31b: "Bohemia shall fight to the end for our sacred faith!"

DD_BOH_32_t: "Prague Congress - Day 2: Clerical Organization"
DD_BOH_32_d: "Clerical organization is an issue that troubles most secular states. Fortunately, our Bohemian Order generally avoids such conflicts. Thanks to the efforts of Jan Hus and his Utraquist followers, we gained considerable autonomy after church reforms. The Bohemian Church employs a dual governance system: most of the time, we are ruled by an Archbishop elected by the All-Bohemian Ecclesiastical Council and recognized by Rome; during wartime, the Grand Master of the military order temporarily assumes leadership over both knights and the Church."
DD_BOH_32a: "The bishops shall continue to rule this nation."
DD_BOH_32b: "Without the sword, how shall I protect our homeland?"

DD_BOH_33_t: "Prague Congress - Day 3: Missionary Purpose"
DD_BOH_33_d: "Initially established solely to combat the wicked Taborites, opportunistic outlaws, and heinous criminals, we founded numerous religious tribunals. However, with the Christian schism, some clergy fear these will soon be needed again. While steadfast faith and noble souls can withstand trials, mortal fragility—both spiritual and physical—cannot. In these times when Catholic faith faces severe tests, should the methods of religious tribunals still be implemented?"
DD_BOH_33a: "Abolish the tribunals; we shall reeducate heretics through humanism."
DD_BOH_33b: "For heretics, only sword and fire!"

DD_BOH_34_t: "Prague Congress - Day 4: Secularization"
DD_BOH_34_d: "Though we are a theocratic state, as the wheel of time rolls forward, theological power continually wanes. The tides of humanism and awakening nationalism constantly erode our cohesion, while centralization and monarchical absolutism replace Christ's servants. Many surrounding theocratic states have transformed into secular or semi-secular theocracies under the Reformation's influence. Admittedly, reforming into a secular state could enhance our cohesion, levy more taxes, and regulate society through law, but it would also undermine our legitimacy to rule."
DD_BOH_34a: "The wave of secularization is inevitable."
DD_BOH_34b: "The Bohemian people still need our guidance."

DD_BOH_35_t: "Prague Congress - Day 5: Military Organization"
DD_BOH_35_d: "Every training session of the Military Order troubles neighboring nations, as they constantly fear the Grand Master's blade—a group of warlike and valiant knights hardly makes for a good neighbor. The Episcopal Council also worries the Grand Master harbors hidden ambitions, awaiting an opportunity to overthrow the Church's leadership and rule. An independent organization controlling military force is hardly suitable for a stable and healthy state. Thus, some propose the Military Order should be reorganized into knightly armies loyal to the Episcopal Council rather than remaining an independent order controlled solely by the Grand Master."
DD_BOH_35a: "The bishops command the army, not the Grand Master."
DD_BOH_35b: "How can we win battles without the Grand Master?"

DD_BOH_36_t: "Prague Congress - Day 6: Idol Worship"
DD_BOH_36_d: "Whenever people speak of the Bohemian Order, Joan of Arc and her legendary deeds in saving Bohemia form an inescapable part of its history. In reality, there exists widespread blind and fervent idol worship of Joan among Bohemian commoners. This completely contradicts doctrine! Even if Joan was canonized, such worship beyond Christ is improper, far exceeding the veneration due to saints."
DD_BOH_36a: "Order the cessation of Joan worship."

In the court at Prague, the king proclaimed the abolition of the old Holy Roman Empire order, establishing a new West Slavic Empire founded upon our proud Slavic traditions.\n\nFormer German princes have either submitted or gone into exile, while the Slavic banner flies for the first time over the battlements of Aachen and Frankfurt. The empire's establishment is not merely a symbol of military victory but also a cultural renaissance—the Czech language and Slavic laws are elevated to dominant status, aiming to blend Germanic and Slavic elements into a diverse yet centralized power.

The red lion's claws proclaim the end of Hohenstaufen rule.

Alongside the universities of Bologna, Paris, and Oxford, it stands as a center of European culture, enrolling students from multiple ethnicities including Bohemians, Germans, Poles, Hungarians, and South Slavs.\n\nEstablished with papal approval, the university comprises four faculties: Theology, Law, Arts, and Medicine, endowed with secular privileges and immunities granted by the king. Archbishop Arnold of Pardubice served as its first chancellor. During the Hussite movement, Charles University, led by then Dean of Arts Jan Hus and later Rector Huss, became the epicenter of church reform.

DD_BOH_rangna_personality_1_desc: "Jeanne d'Arc, the Maid of Orléans from distant France, hearing of the bloody horrors of the Hussite Wars and called by angels, traveled far to Bohemia to help the kingdom resist heresy. She earned the title of Military Governor of Lusatia by slaying a bandit lord who followed heretical beliefs.\n\nSeeing people oppressed by slaughter and homes burned by flames, Joan understood that fighting and saving were her mission. Her enemies were not only misguided heretics but also evil marauders and invaders who committed every atrocity—burning, killing, and plundering."
DD_BOH_rangna_personality_2: "The Maiden of Bohemia"
DD_BOH_rangna_personality_2_desc: "Jeanne d'Arc, the Maid of Orléans from distant France, hearing of the bloody horrors of the Hussite Wars and called by angels, traveled far to Bohemia to help the kingdom resist heresy. She earned the title of Military Governor of Lusatia by slaying a bandit lord who followed heretical beliefs.\n\nWar, war—no matter how she swung her sword, the remnants of the Hussites spread like wildfire. Violence and hatred still plagued Bohemia, and the ideal for which she had sacrificed everything remained stagnant. She grew weary of war—tearing up truces to eradicate heresy completely and end it all."

The Church's saint understood—ideals are not as simple and pure as doctrines."

DD_BOH_rangna_personality_4_desc: "Everything in the past blurred like smoke, and former companions had all departed from her life. More than once, she wept in the deep night, doubting in the darkness—was the choice she made back then truly right? Was that sacred, noble, holy ideal truly worth abandoning all precious things in her life to dedicate herself to?\n\nThe Church praised her deeds, poets sang her epics, devout people saw her as a saint walking among mortals. But the ignorant maiden from Domrémy now remembered only one thing—the servant of the Heavenly Father had entrusted her with a heavy responsibility, and her mission as a messenger was not yet complete."
DD_BOH_rangna_personality_5: "\"The Saint\""
DD_BOH_rangna_personality_5_desc: "The first half of her life was that of a hero admired by all; the latter half, a leader feared by many. She once dreamed of the future like a maiden and fought with all her might like a warrior. Her achievements spread as far as her infamy; the flowers she received were as countless as the curses she endured.\n\nShe was that simple, naive village woman, that smiling, radiant maiden, that brave and fearless warrior, that compassionate and kind believer, that lonely, struggling leader, that martyr who abandoned everything.\n\nShe is a saint, yet also mortal. She was born thus, and so she shall remain."
