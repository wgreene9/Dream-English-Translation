DD_LOM_1_t: "The Dissolution of the Lombard League"
DD_LOM_1_d: "No matter how much the Italians hoped for this day to come or desperately prayed for it not to, the collapse of the Lombard League was inevitable. Since Venice withdrew from the league and the emperor's threat receded, internal conflicts within the league have grown. After the ambitious Duke of Milan expelled Genoa from the alliance, the Genoese Doge could no longer unite the league.\n\nNow, the members of the league are either under the control of the Duke of Milan or have withdrawn from the league. The once-mighty giant has crumbled, and the Italian states have finally gone their separate ways. This means the political balance in the Apennines will be disrupted, and a new power reshuffle is imminent."
DD_LOM_1a: "One can never control the tides of the times."

Unrest stirred by guilds and artisans grew increasingly frequent, yet the city guards showed no willingness to maintain order. Everyone knew the reason behind this—the commander of the guards, Alliance Field Marshal Duke Filippo Maria Visconti, was the mastermind behind it all. He and his unscrupulous Imperial Faction were tearing the nation apart, and Domenico felt powerless.\n\nA biting cold wind seeped through the cracks in the window and swept into the office, making Domenico shiver. After Genoa's expulsion from the alliance, he, now without support, felt like a bewildered jailer, imprisoned in Milan alongside his enraged people. This could not continue. Before the situation descended into utter chaos, he had to do something.\n\n"Luigi!" The Doge called his secretary in and handed him two letters, sealed with a complex and ornate wax stamp in crimson red—the emblem of the alliance government. "Deliver this letter to the Archbishop of Milan. As for the other..." He glanced at the flustered young man before him and hesitated, pulling his hand back."

Domenico had a servant pour a steaming cup of tea for the Papal envoy, observing the young envoy across the table. Unlike the weary and dejected-looking Doge, the envoy appeared graceful and spirited.\n\n'In short, Your Excellency, Rome is fully prepared to support you and your efforts,' the envoy offered him a proper smile, the exquisite and noble golden cross on his chest shimmering with an enchanting glow in the candlelight of dusk. 'As long as the Church's rightful position and the Holy See's authority are guaranteed, we will not allow unscrupulous individuals to undermine Italy's unity.'\n\nWell, perhaps the Medicis and their faction would be satisfied with this, but regardless, I have no other choice.

Yet, it had to be admitted, this fellow understood politics. Though sometimes endearingly naive and idealistic, Domenico Doria was certainly no fool.\n\nNow, the League's Doge was actually requesting that he dispatch troops into Milan, disguised as Lombard League forces under the banner of the 'League Guard'. Was this foolish alliance finally about to collapse?

The setting sun on the horizon slowly withdrew its fading light from the deep red wine glass in his hand. Since leaving his family, he had rarely attended such events, but this was undoubtedly the most sumptuous feast in his memory. He sighed inwardly—truly befitting the Pope's banker. It seemed God granted His faithful servants far more than just the salvation of their souls.\n\n'Good evening, Your Excellency.' An elder of the Medici family appeared beside Domenico with a wine glass. The elegant banker raised his cup to him like a true noble. 'To our shared future.'

The young and dynamic general is talented, exceptionally courageous, and certainly far superior to some senile old man or a pampered aristocratic appointee. However, the biggest issue is—he is the son-in-law of the Duke of Milan.\n\nThis is no small matter. The Republican Faction would normally never accept such a person becoming Field Marshal. Yet the Sanctuary Faction has defended the general, arguing that he has served both the Papacy and the Sanctuary Faction on multiple occasions, and has even defended Republican and League interests. Rather than being a supporter of the Duke of Milan, it might be more accurate to say General Sforza is a pure opportunist; he is loyal only to profit and himself."

With the loss of ducal rule, some Republican factions in Milan, incited by foreign supporters, have begun semi-publicly attacking the Imperial Faction, resisting Imperial officials and garrisons.\n\nAccording to our informants, due to our support for Marshal Sforza's claim to Milan, certain local scholars and radical Republicans are plotting something, and clearly they do not intend to inform us in advance. Milan's rebellious attitude has angered many claimants to the duchy and their armies. A succession crisis is imminent, and the shadow of chaos once again looms over Lombardy."

Institutions like the University of Pavia widely promote the golden age of the old Republic. Through the efforts of radical Republicans, a republic named after the 4th-century Archbishop of Milan, Saint Ambrose, has been declared, aiming to permanently expel monarchy from Milan.\n\nUnsurprisingly, not everyone welcomes this decision, especially the claimant to the Duchy of Milan, Francesco Sforza. He has already marched his army to the city gates and sent a strongly-worded letter: either accept him as Duke, or face him on the battlefield. The Imperial Faction generals support Sforza's stance.

He murdered his own elder brother and executed his lawful wife. His paranoia, cruelty, and remarkable dictatorial prowess have made the name Visconti the foremost noble house in Lombardy, surrounding the title of Duke of Milan with blood and glory.\n\nNow, this fragile alliance is inevitably approaching its end, and the Imperial Faction's ambitious men can no longer restrain the fire in their hearts. The Field Marshal and his Imperial officers will not hesitate to end the rule of the republican government, excising it like a cancerous tumor. The conspirators have already secretly extended olive branches to the Emperor's and the Church's followers, hoping to unite with the Sanctuary Faction and submit to the Empire in exchange for recognition of the iron crown upon the Duke's head.\n\nThe Duke gazes upon this dying league, much as he did decades ago on that rain-soaked night that earned him the name fratricide, looking back upon his now aged self, the conqueror grown old.

He quietly observed Italy beyond the window—the shimmering evening glow, half-submerged in the encroaching night, casting its mantle over the golden domes at the city's heart, warm as a sunset reflecting on a clear pond, cold as moonlight striking a frigid river.

The dawn of peace and hope has finally returned to this beleaguered city, to the scarred League.\n\nSymbols of the Visconti family and the Imperial Faction are being removed from across Lombardy. The League, amidst ruins and fading smoke, stumbles forward—slowly but steadily returning to its proper course. The citizens of Milan take to the streets, celebrating the defeat of the dictators. Even the silent churches have raised the League's banner once more. A new, reorganized Lombard government will replace the chaotic rule of the past, ushering in a fresh era of unity."

DD_LOM_30_t:"The Treaty of Venice"
DD_LOM_30_d:"On land, our offensive against the Republic of Venice could be described as sweeping and unstoppable. Yet, before their final line of defense—the Venetian Lagoon—cannons and swords seem so ineffective. As a maritime empire once bathed in glory, Venice's navy remains the most powerful naval force in the entire Mediterranean; breaching this aquatic wall is truly difficult for us.\n\nThus, the Venetian Doge has sent us a proposal: in exchange for Venice's mainland territories, allow Venice to become an autonomous city under the League's protection, enjoying freedom and the right to conduct commerce while submitting to Lombardy, thereby ending the war. Shall we accept the Venetians' offer?"
DD_LOM_30a:"End this pointless attrition."
DD_LOM_30b:"No, we shall plant our banners upon the Doge's Palace of Venice!"

NYDD_LOM_winter_is_coming_desc:"The Lombard League was originally formed merely to oppose Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I 'Barbarossa'; no one could have foreseen its survival to this day. An anonymous, well-known Medici commentator remarked: 'Lombardy is like a dilapidated house; one gentle kick, and it will come crashing down.' Indeed, years of intrigue surrounding the Italian city-states have driven away two of the most esteemed republics. What is the worst that could happen? Merely a return to the starting point. The newly appointed Doge harbors ambitious ideals, striving to hold together this vast, loose alliance. But for many, they hope it will dissolve sooner rather than later."
