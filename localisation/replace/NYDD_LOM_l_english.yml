DD_LOM_1_t: "The Dissolution of the Lombard League"
DD_LOM_1_d: "No matter how much the Italians hoped for this day to come or desperately prayed for it not to, the collapse of the Lombard League was inevitable. Since Venice withdrew from the league and the emperor's threat receded, internal conflicts within the league have grown. After the ambitious Duke of Milan expelled Genoa from the alliance, the Genoese Doge could no longer unite the league.\n\nNow, the members of the league are either under the control of the Duke of Milan or have withdrawn from the league. The once-mighty giant has crumbled, and the Italian states have finally gone their separate ways. This means the political balance in the Apennines will be disrupted, and a new power reshuffle is imminent."
