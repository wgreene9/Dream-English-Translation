DD_LOM_1_t: "The Dissolution of the Lombard League"
DD_LOM_1_d: "No matter how much the Italians hoped for this day to come or desperately prayed for it not to, the collapse of the Lombard League was inevitable. Since Venice withdrew from the league and the emperor's threat receded, internal conflicts within the league have grown. After the ambitious Duke of Milan expelled Genoa from the alliance, the Genoese Doge could no longer unite the league.\n\nNow, the members of the league are either under the control of the Duke of Milan or have withdrawn from the league. The once-mighty giant has crumbled, and the Italian states have finally gone their separate ways. This means the political balance in the Apennines will be disrupted, and a new power reshuffle is imminent."
DD_LOM_1a: "One can never control the tides of the times."

DD_LOM_6_t:"Dreamer Trapped in Yesterday"
DD_LOM_6_d:"Domenico Doria was born into the Doria family during the twilight of the Lombard League's golden age. From Tribune of the Plebs in Liguria, to Doge of Genoa, and then to League Administrator, in Domenico's heart, he considered himself a proud Lombard first, not merely a citizen of Genoa. Thus, when he resigned as Doge upon being elected League Administrator, his passionate heart burned with the ambition to restore his homeland.\n\nUnfortunately, no one in this land still regards Lombardy as their fatherland. The Italian states, freed from the Imperial threat, have inevitably drifted toward division, and the fragile League Council has lost its balance alongside. Duke Visconti of Milan leads the Imperial Faction, favoring the Empire and monarchy, while the Sanctuary Faction, guided by the southern Papacy, has grown increasingly dissatisfied since the Holy See's withdrawal. Ultimately, the Republican Faction, led by Genoa, was decisively defeated by the Imperial Faction after Venice left the League, resulting in Genoa's expulsion and the Duke of Milan gradually seizing power.\n\nNow, Domenico faces a fractured and broken nation. The Duke of Milan conceals his ambition less and less, seeking to claim the entire north as his private domain. The disgruntled Sanctuary Faction and the dejected Republicans have also lost confidence in the government. A profound sense of powerlessness binds the Lombard Administrator. He is Lombardy's helmsman, yet now seems a prisoner of yesterday. If he still dreams of saving his country... he must either turn to Christ or gamble everything for his homeland."

Unrest stirred by guilds and artisans grew increasingly frequent, yet the city guards showed no willingness to maintain order. Everyone knew the reason behind this—the commander of the guards, Alliance Field Marshal Duke Filippo Maria Visconti, was the mastermind behind it all. He and his unscrupulous Imperial Faction were tearing the nation apart, and Domenico felt powerless.\n\nA biting cold wind seeped through the cracks in the window and swept into the office, making Domenico shiver. After Genoa's expulsion from the alliance, he, now without support, felt like a bewildered jailer, imprisoned in Milan alongside his enraged people. This could not continue. Before the situation descended into utter chaos, he had to do something.\n\n"Luigi!" The Doge called his secretary in and handed him two letters, sealed with a complex and ornate wax stamp in crimson red—the emblem of the alliance government.

Domenico had a servant pour a steaming cup of tea for the Papal envoy, observing the young envoy across the table. Unlike the weary and dejected-looking Doge, the envoy appeared graceful and spirited.\n\n'In short, Your Excellency, Rome is fully prepared to support you and your efforts,' the envoy offered him a proper smile, the exquisite and noble golden cross on his chest shimmering with an enchanting glow in the candlelight of dusk. 'As long as the Church's rightful position and the Holy See's authority are guaranteed, we will not allow unscrupulous individuals to undermine Italy's unity.'\n\nWell, perhaps the Medicis and their faction would be satisfied with this, but regardless, I have no other choice. As the Doge lowered his head to scrutinize the treaty's details, he heard the young envoy's low voice echo beside his ear once more.

Yet, it had to be admitted, this fellow understood politics. Though sometimes endearingly naive and idealistic, Domenico Doria was certainly no fool.\n\nNow, the League's Doge was actually requesting that he dispatch troops into Milan, disguised as Lombard League forces under the banner of the 'League Guard'.

The setting sun on the horizon slowly withdrew its fading light from the deep red wine glass in his hand. Since leaving his family, he had rarely attended such events, but this was undoubtedly the most sumptuous feast in his memory. He sighed inwardly—truly befitting the Pope's banker. It seemed God granted His faithful servants far more than just the salvation of their souls.\n\n'Good evening, Your Excellency.'

However, with the Duke's death, the position of Alliance Field Marshal is now vacant again. This sensitive and crucial post absolutely must not fall to another ambitious schemer like Visconti.

Yet the Sanctuary Faction has defended the general, arguing that he has served both the Papacy and the Sanctuary Faction on multiple occasions, and has even defended Republican and League interests.

His son-in-law, the brilliant General Francesco Sforza, as the Duke's sole heir, has become the new Duke of Milan.\n\nDespite the passing of the Imperial Faction's leader, the weak League government remains powerless over the military forces controlled by the Imperial Faction. The Imperial generals promptly rallied behind and endorsed Duke Sforza as their leader and, without the Doge's approval, seized control of the military command, electing him as the new Field Marshal of all Lombardy.\n\nNow, the rogue military command is acting entirely on its own.

Milan, the heart of Italy, the jewel upon the Iron Crown—this city is destined to be companioned by blood and power.\n\nWhen Duke Visconti placed Milan in his hands, when the Duke signed his name upon that will, did he already foresee this outcome? Sforza gazed at Milan in the dim twilight, as if transported back to the battlefields where he once fought alongside his father. Back then, he was merely a bastard, dreaming impractical dreams—yet now, the humble surname Sforza is poised to become that of a sovereign ruler of Italy."

'Piero, gather all the guards Florence can muster. You will lead them.' 'For what purpose, Father?' Since the disgrace of the Luccan War and the death of his brother Giovanni, this was the first time Piero had seen his father look so grave.\n\nThe elder Cosimo gazed towards the vanishing corona of the sun in the distance, looking northward where the twilight bled with a desolate hue. Cosimo's heart, which had remained still as stagnant water for decades, suddenly stirred, throbbing with the same fervent intensity as when he had battled the Albizzi family in his youth. He quietly observed Italy beyond the window—the shimmering evening glow, half-submerged in the encroaching night, casting its mantle over the golden domes at the city's heart, warm as a sunset reflecting on a clear pond, cold as moonlight striking a frigid river.

He initially served in the Papal Guard, later moving between France, Italy, and the Holy Roman Empire. While helping his uncle suppress the Corsican rebellion, Andrea gradually revealed his talent for commanding fleets. Eventually, he led the League's navy to defeat the French and Imperial fleets, earning him the titles Prince of Melfi and League Admiral.\n\nPolitically, the Admiral called for constitutional reform within the League and implemented it in his homeland, where he served as 'perpetual censor.' By establishing a consortium of twenty-eight families, he ended the factional strife that had divided Genoa, successfully consolidating the once-fractious Republican Faction.

In Rome, under the Holy See's very gaze, Lorenzo and his brothers could even influence the conclaves of the Sacred College.\n\nOver decades of political life, Lorenzo successfully crushed the 'Pazzi Conspiracy' within the Sanctuary Faction, firmly anchoring the faction's leadership and papal influence within the Medici family. This earned him the acclaim of Italians, who praised him as the 'Compass of the Italian Scales.'

The Lombardy he inherited was merely a rotting ship on the verge of breaking apart, and before that, he was just another young, passionate Doge of Genoa. But fiery zeal and shadowy political dealings allowed him to successfully unite the Sanctuary Faction, thwart the Imperial Faction's schemes, and save his imperiled homeland in the depths of a bitter winter.\n\nBut was it truly so? Whether in the eyes of outsiders or within the Lombard League itself, this seemingly unbreakable alliance remained riddled with holes. The independent league city-states across the land were still united in name only, each going their own way. Having defeated the Imperial Faction, tomorrow some Greek Faction or Peninsula Faction might spring up to threaten the League again. But at least, the Winter of Chaos has passed.

Would it have been better, or worse? But for Domenico, these were now the futile fantasies of a loser who had run out of moves. The League was dying irrevocably; it was no longer anyone's fatherland.\n\nThis place he had regarded as his homeland for over a decade, this pitiable yet hateful country, this landscape he had once burned with passion to protect—it was now rapidly flashing past the carriage window, torn to shreds by the howling wind. Domenico pulled out that bottle of fine wine, aged since his inauguration, from his luggage and drank deeply from the bottle like a common drunkard on the street. It was a congratulatory gift given to him on his first day in office by a merchant named Hermundo, said to be a fine vintage from distant Iberia."

After leaving the government, he retired to the countryside and produced the work Discourses on the First Ten Books of Titus Livy (on Rome) for the League. This great work of political theory emphasizes designing institutions to prevent corruption, advocates for safeguarding civic liberty through legal innovation, critiques the negative influence of Christianity on secular politics, and argues for a constitutional republic as a superior form of government, superior to both monarchies and theocracies, aiming to establish a secularized, politically free republic."

Seeking the patronage of the Sforza family, he wrote his great political work The Prince and dedicated it to the Duke Sforza himself.

DD_LOM_69_d:"The Grand Council of Italy is a legislative body that evolved from the Milanese councils of the League era and even earlier, originally serving as autonomous city council assemblies for citizen participation in urban governance. After the Visconti family came to rule Milan, the Grand Council became the legislative and decision-making body of the Duchy of Milan. Although its powers were limited, it retained certain advisory functions as a body representing the citizenry, and even established its legal standing by conferring the ducal title upon Francesco Sforza.\n\nDuring the Sforza dynasty's rule, the ever-strengthening princely power further weakened the council's functions, turning it into a symbolic institution—or even a tool for the monarchy to give its decrees a veneer of legitimacy—and it became increasingly marginalized. To this day, Italy has not convened the Grand Council for nearly a century. However, with financial difficulties making it increasingly hard for the monarchy to maintain stability in Italy, a decision has finally been made to reconvene the Grand Council—though those in the know understand that the new council will still be nothing more than a tool for the royal family to get what it wants."

This group has infiltrated deeply, and its reach may not be limited to Gaul alone. Clearly, they are plotting something. Recommend taking measures... and request Roman intervention."\n\nThe pale orange morning light spilled through the clear window frame onto the luxurious dark silver dinnerware, yet it felt like countless needles, sending a genuine chill through the Governor. His shadow, stretched long by the bright dawn light, was pinned against the office's ornate wallpaper like a desperate, grotesque monster. No, Rome must not find out.

Matteo leaned sideways against the iron door outside the interrogation room, an unlit cigarette holder dangling from his lips.

One could hardly expect loyalty from troops composed of lowly Free State people, but this was a chaos capable of engulfing Europe in destruction, plunging the entire Mediterranean into warfire like in the days of ancient Rome.\n\n'Captain! Captain!' Paolo rushed into his room, forgetting even to knock. 'What is it?!' Matteo roared at him, on the verge of collapse. The poor soldier trembled like a sieve, then immediately straightened his back like a pine and reported: 'Sorry, Captain, but the list related to Toulon is out. I'm afraid they are all either accomplices in the Bagaudae organization, or at least beneficiaries...'\n\nMatteo snatched the crumpled paper. His bloodshot eyes seemed filled with gore. Francesco di Fanano, Guido Cigliani, Luca Nocadio, Roberto Crosetto... This small, yellowed, tattered old paper was densely packed with names as numerous as stars—virtually a roster of Free State officials and officers. A fine layer of sweat beaded on the Captain's palm, staining the paper's edges with dark sweat marks. He felt an uncontrollable ache throbbing in his wrist.

'Got it. Now, we just wait quietly.' Straye sat down on the wooden planks of the harbor, took off his cap, and placed it on his lap, gazing peacefully at the silver sea in the distance like a true veteran.\n\nThe clear, brilliant moon shone like a silver disc, its piercing rays, like Artemis's silver arrows, stabbing through the oppressive clouds. Moonlight cascaded down like silken snow, gently embracing the deep blue coast in the twilight, laying down a straight silver path that seemed to lead straight to heaven, yet plunge into the deep blue sea.\n\nVictor sat nearby with the other comrades, disheartened, mimicking Straye by looking out at the boundless lunar sea. After a long while, he spoke, dazed.\n\n'Captain... we will succeed, right?' 'Mm.'\n'Will... will many people die?' 'Mm.'\n'Then,' Victor turned his young face towards his leader, seeing the cold, hard profile of Straye's time-worn face etched by the pale moonlight, 'will we die too?'\n\n'Maybe.' Straye exhaled softly, tearing his gaze from the distant lunar sea to look at the boy beside him. 'But we must bequeath to our descendants a free people, a free soul, even if it costs us everything we have now. However—'\n\nBefore he could finish, a deafening roar exploded on the distant shore.

Unlike his eldest brother, who would inherit the knight's title and work in the government in Paris, and unlike his younger brother, who could digest those thick, heavy Bibles, he was expelled from the seminary, taking only his sketchpad. What he wanted to paint was never the weeping Madonna, but the gently swaying wheat fields under the autumn sun.\n\nEventually, he ended up in the army he detested, muddled through a few years, and after retiring, used his father's connections with the Italians to become the constable in his hometown. He was still young, but his elder brother always looked at him with annoyance, cursing him for being as useless as an old man in a coffin. Perhaps. But in his little town, Claude had never felt so young and alive. In April, the French spring was enchanting.

He called out to Madame Jeanne's playful tabby cat, who always ran out at night and made Claude open the door for him. A few soft meows came from the courtyard, drawing him to follow the sound.\n\n'Velvet—I've come to get you.' Pushing open the wooden courtyard gate, Claude was startled and stumbled back a step. Before him stood a petite girl with long, flowing blonde hair; the limpid moonlight mingled with the cool evening breeze, gently stirring her locks. 'You've come to get me, how lovely.' The girl holding the cat seemed to snap out of a reverie in the bright night, smiling brightly at him. Childhood memories suddenly flooded Claude's mind, making him see stars. Before him was unmistakably the little girl who used to drag him by the hand and run through the whole town!\n\nVelvet jumped down from the unknown girl's arms and rubbed against Claude's leg. 'So cute, what's its name?' 'Claude.' 'What a strange name for a cat?' 'Uh, no... that's my name.' Claude felt his face must be as red as a branding iron. 'Oh, I see. My name is Camille.' The girl laughed crisply, standing in the moonlit courtyard. Even the silver stars in the sky seemed less radiant than her smile. The wind sighed softly, the moon kept silent.

The ale was just as bitter, yet somehow, Claude found it far sweeter than the deep red wine.\n\nHe picked up his sketchpad again, transferring his world onto its small, humble pages. On a lush green meadow, a girl in a white dress stood in the middle of a field of flowers, soft white blossoms gently swaying against her bare, delicate ankles. The parasol she held blocked most of the sunlight, leaving only a sprinkle of starlight dotting her brilliant golden hair, as dazzling and lovely as a hairpin.

Claude was indeed a constable just muddling through life, but he would never, could never, hand his town, his world, over to them.\n\n'Halt!' He cornered him in a dead end, raising his musket and aiming squarely at the criminal before him. The small figure turned. The hazy, dim moon filtered through thick clouds, so that in the deep night, Claude could almost—almost—not make out his face. A gentle evening breeze stirred his thin hood, revealing a flash of golden hair. Claude felt his wrist ache as if bitten by a viper; it trembled so much he could barely hold the gun.\n\nThe constable's left hand fiercely gripped his own gun-wielding wrist. The musket's muzzle dipped for an instant, then was suddenly raised towards the night sky. A bang! shattered the silence, startling the nightingales on the eaves.

Cheerful dance music seeped through the door cracks into [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s room, dancing lightly and freely around his ears. He could almost already hear the guests' chatter on the dance floor and smell the rich aroma of wine.\n\nCasually picking up a bottle of wine from the table, [Root.Monarch.GetName] pushed open the doors to the balcony overlooking the main hall. Beneath the enormous crystal chandelier, the musicians in the orchestra were still playing, and the enthusiastic guests had already noticed their host's arrival. Basking in praise and adulation, [Root.Monarch.GetName] walked into the center amidst a wave of applause. The graceful host raised his glass, smiling as he welcomed his guests: 'Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for being here tonight—'\n\nUntil a thunderous blast cut him off.\n\nIn an instant, the shattered crystal chandelier, creaking loudly, crashed to the floor like a dying monster—and tongues of fire shot up along the boiling blood and wine.

The Medici's retribution was always so swift and cruel—the family's 'Cleaners' emerged from every corner of the city until they got what they wanted. In the darkness, the tip of the cigar glowed a faint crimson.

A marked-up map of the Empire hung on the wall. 'But out of six hundred seats in the Grand Council, commoners hold only one hundred and fifty, and all their proposals have been shelved.' Without looking up, the editor continued, scribbling on paper, 'The new National Assembly is mobilizing its strength. We will no longer allow our reasonable demands to be deceived and betrayed by these damned lackeys. Constitution—our goal is a new constitution, a new society!'\n\nThe door was suddenly knocked with a signal: three shorts and a long. A woman wrapped in a cloak slipped inside. 'The Emperor approved the Public Assembly Restriction Act today,' she said breathlessly. 'The gendarmerie is closing down all the cafes in Venice.' Giovanni lifted a floorboard and took out a bundle of pamphlets wrapped in oilcloth. The cover of the top one showed a broken scepter and an overlapping Italian tricolor—a symbol that had been quietly spreading through Italy's slums, universities, and workshops.\n\n'Go, Giovanni, quickly!' The editor stuffed the last stack of newspapers into a drainage pipe, as the machine beside him rumbled, printing collections of fairy-tale poems. 'The National Assembly will act soon, and we are the poets of revolt!'\n\nBy the time the gendarmes' boots tramped through the rain-washed streets, the print shop had long since returned to silence.

Behind him trailed his flustered and panicked Royal Secretary, chattering incessantly about bad news concerning the National Assembly.\n\n'Massive demonstrations have occurred in several cities across Italy—textile workers and citizens have taken to the streets in Genoa, Venice, Rome, and Milan,' the Royal Secretary's voice trembled. 'They demand the Empire recognize the National Assembly and create a constitution based on popular will—Your Majesty! Your Majesty!'\n\nThe bright, dazzling sunlight burst through the stained-glass windows, trampled underfoot by the glaring, furious Emperor. Portraits of successive Italian monarchs lined the long corridor, from triumphant ancestors to an awe-inspiring grandfather, to an elegant and composed father. Under the gaze of these emperors, in the dappled light of the corridor, he finally stopped at its end. The sharp thumping of the silver cane ceased abruptly.\n\nThe final emperor sat within his gilded frame, silently gazing at himself.\n\nThe oppressive morning light failed to climb onto the portrait's attire; the Emperor's entire face was cast in the corridor's shadow. A silver star, radiating an intense iron will, was pinned to the military uniform's chest, gleaming brightly. The face in the portrait revealed no emotion—no benevolence, majesty, pride, anger, joy, or sorrow. Nothing. That inscrutable face held only a stark, barren blankness.\n\nAfter a long moment, the Emperor's withered, prominent knuckles tightened around his cane again. He turned to his pitiful attendant:"

On the east bank of the bridge, the Imperial Guard's phalanx stood like a bronze forest; the banner held aloft by the standard-bearer had its edges already stained by the marks of war. On the west bank, a crowd in motley clothing stood in silence. Those in the front held guns seized from armories, while behind them rose pitchforks and halberds. That dust-covered battle flag slowly unfurled in the morning breeze.\n\nCanisters of grapeshot silently stood amidst the smoke, their dark muzzles seemingly roaring with fury. 'Lay down your weapons!' the Governor's voice drifted through the cold morning mist, indistinctly reaching the other side of the long bridge. 'Italy will punish only the chief culprits!' The response from the opposite bank was an ancient folk song, at first just scattered humming, then swelling into a tidal wave of unison voices—it was a harvest song, now fitted with lyrics more suited to this bloody melody: 'Ancestors' bones sing in the mire, demanding the tyrant's head roll from its throne—'\n\nBowstrings hummed, matchlocks flashed orange, and the clash of blades shattered the morning like hailstones. This nation, bathed in blood, was split in two at that moment: one half, a thousand-year crown crumbling; the other half, a yet-unformed, bleeding dawn. The flag across the bridge fell in the smoke and rose again. A one-armed man, his empty sleeve fluttered in the wind like another banner.\n\nThe blood on the bridge would not dry until autumn.

If it weren't for these rebels who ignore everything, Italy would be thriving.\n\nBut can we also not see the red-stained flags and bridges? They are called traitors, yet I have never seen a time when rebels' blood was enough to dye the Rubicon itself red!
