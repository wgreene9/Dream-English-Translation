DD_ASU_1_t: "Struggle and Division"
DD_ASU_1_d: "Centuries ago, Iberia was nearly lost. Yet the resilient Iberians never yielded. From the last ember preserved in Asturias to the present day's overwhelming struggle against the heathens, the flames of resistance and freedom have never been extinguished.\n\nEven at the most perilous times, the infidels could never fully conquer Iberia. On these final cliffs, we shall continue to fight fearlessly. In the darkest hours, there were still those who held high the beacon, guiding us to stand firm here.\n\nHowever, what pains all Iberian rulers most is that the greatest damage to the Reconquista never came from the infidels' brutal counterattacks—it was the ancient law of partition. Countless times when victory over the heathens was within reach, everything vanished like smoke upon a king's death. All territories were divided among the late king's children, these sinners of the holy cause who never considered the greater good, only their own interests. Thus, each time the Reconquista crushed the infidels, division and infighting allowed them to resurge.\n\nDefeat the infidels, reconquer; split, be defeated by infidels, reconquer again; unite, defeat infidels, reconquer thrice; split again... This endless cycle wearies even the hardiest Iberians. Despairingly, the reunified Kingdom of Asturias faces the same inevitable cycle in the foreseeable future.\n\nTo return Iberia to Iberians' embrace, the Reconquista must be accelerated. For this, we must reform, break this endless cycle, and eradicate all hidden obstacles!"

DD_ASU_1a_tt: "If the mission '§YEnact New Succession§!' is not completed before §YCarlos I§! dies, @ASU[Root.GetName] will §Rsplit§! again!\n"

DD_ASU_2_t: "Succession of Asturias"
DD_ASU_2_d: "As King of Asturias and 'Emperor of All Spain,' Carlos I has many heirs—a troubling prospect, for his realm will fracture upon his death.\n\nEven ignoring this, succession is complicated. His favored eldest son, Prince Carlos, shows no regal qualities. Handsome and charming, he could have been an excellent heir. But coddled as the primary heir, he became a profligate wastrel.\n\nPrince Carlos knows how to charm, but only toward noble ladies. Among peers, he is arrogant and rude. His haughtiness bred discontent. A noble once privately called him 'a peacock meant for the table,' soon spreading as 'the Incompetent Parrot.' When Carlos I formally named him heir, 'the Inept' became his secret epithet. Several nobles petitioned against this decision. As heir, the philandering Carlos is woefully unfit, yet remains the most legitimate claimant.\n\nBeyond the problematic Carlos, Carlos I has two capable sons:\n\nSecond son Alfonso of León, granted León at birth, is benevolent and popular. However, his religious tolerance toward Muslims displeases clergy and knights. León faces revolts for welcoming Muslim refugees. On the frontlines against infidels, Alfonso's mercy is seen as a betrayal of ancestral blood. Yet his compassion may benefit the realm.\n\nThird son Enrique of Castile, a legitimized bastard, grew up with his mother until adulthood. Many doubt his legitimacy, despite Carlos I granting him Castile. Enrique's fanaticism against Muslims earns him acclaim. He vows to conquer Seville and join Mauritanian holy warriors. Undoubtedly, he would be a spear against the infidels.\n\nNevertheless, Carlos remains Carlos I's beloved son, and passing the crown to him is understandable. Alternatively, honoring one's favorite while choosing a suitable heir for the cause may also be wise."
DD_ASU_2a: "The throne remains with Carlos. I'll educate him well."
DD_ASU_2a_tt: "Nothing changes. Sometimes, inaction is best.\n"
DD_ASU_2b: "Few in our realm are as kind as Alfonso."

DD_ASU_3_t: "Shadows Approach"
DD_ASU_3_d: "In Iberia's shadows lurk endless sin and darkness. Now, this terror reaches the ruler's doorstep. In an Asturian estate, a shadow slips past guards—muffled groans, falling bodies. A seasoned assassin moves toward the chamber of Iberia's most revered monarch: the 'Emperor of All Spain.'\n\nThe assassin strides through storm-lashed corridors, torchlight flickering. The grand door looms. He enters silently, ending an era. Darkness fills the room—until lightning flashes, revealing a sword-wielding figure. Steel glints on the assassin's shocked face..."

His chest faintly rises—a fading heartbeat.\n\nThe lion who united Iberia is broken, only his golden ring hinting at past glory. 'Forgive me, child...' he gasps, gazing at his heir. 'I wished to leave you peace... but God wills otherwise.'\n\nGasping, he implores, 'Fight for Iberia... let your soul ignite for our realm. Flesh builds pillars; God guards lost souls.' Blood chokes his final words.\n\n'Go... grasp not my hand, but your destiny.'"

DD_ASU_6_t: "Intervene in Asturian Civil War"
# DD_ASU_6_d: "Northern mountains loom under twilight, tension thick as pre-storm air. In Asturias, brothers feud—faith and power tear the north. Cross-bearing banners are stained with fraternal blood. We, [Root.GetName], watch from the storm's edge.\n\nWe've been both foe and ally to them. Taifa's fate once swayed between northern and southern currents. Now, the unshakable Catholic kingdoms fracture. Once-revered names now mirror greed and despair.\n\nThe north's sky darkens, but before thunder comes blood's scent. Every realm awaits the spark. Asturias' glory fades; León stirs in ruins; Castile readies its bloodstained throne. When flames rise, all will be consumed.\n\nThis is no distant strife—it is fate's omen. The rift opens. We who retreated before their blades now see them turned inward. Will we shape this chaos or claim its ashes?"
DD_ASU_6_d: "The northern mountains rise and fall somberly in the twilight, a silent shadow enveloping the land. The air is thick with an indescribable tension, like the calm before a storm, holding one's breath. In the land of Asturias, brothers have become enemies, and the conflict between faith and power is like molten lava, ready to erupt at any moment. The banner once raised high with the cross is now stained with the blood of fratricide, and we, [Root.GetName], stand on the edge of the storm, coldly watching the chaos that is about to tear the north apart.\n\nWe have been both their enemies and their friends. In those long and turbulent years, the fate of Taifa drifted in the torrents of the north and south. Now, the north is no longer the unshakable fortress it once was; the once united Catholic kingdoms have disintegrated, sinking into a quagmire of mutual slaughter. The names that once inspired awe in our Muslim brethren are now but shattered mirrors, reflecting uncontrolled desires and desperate ambitions.\n\nThe northern sky has long been overcast, but before the thunder arrives, we can already smell the foreboding of blood and fire. Every nation is waiting for that final spark to fall, waiting for an opportunity to favor their future. The glory of Asturias has dimmed, the banner symbolizing Catholic radiance flutters in the civil war, and former comrades have turned against each other. León, with its unfulfilled ambitions, stirs restlessly in these ruins, seeking to rise from the chaos. And Castile, that bloodthirsty monster, is preparing to paint its throne with blood. Once the northern flames of war ignite, they will consume everything, and every cry in the wind will add a new echo to this catastrophe.\n\nThis is no longer a distant conflict, but a harbinger of fate. The fissures in the north have already opened. We once retreated step by step under their blades, but now we see those blades turned against themselves. The smoke of the battlefield has yet to rise, but we must decide whether to reach out and alter the course of this turbulent game, or to pick up the shattered remnants after the storm.\n\nThe omens of the storm are already circling in the sky, and when the first drop of rain falls, no one can afford to watch from the sidelines."

However, Sancho had no interest in the throne, yearning only for distant tides. He requested retirement lands early, which Carlos gladly granted.\n\nNow rumors spread that after Carlos' death, Sancho will join the succession crisis.

His father had not come to his wedding, and even his usually close mother sat far in the back, looking at him with concern. 'Do not be yoked together with unbelievers!' His father's angry face, brandishing a Bible, flashed before his eyes. Indeed, marrying a Moor was hard for many to accept. Fortunately, the kind-hearted parish priest was still willing to officiate this not widely blessed union.\n\nBut when he lifted the bride's veil, all doubts and heaviness were cast aside. What a beautiful girl she was. A shy smile graced her youthful and lovely face, with a blush tinting her fair cheeks, and a healthy golden complexion that radiated vitality. Enchanted, he cupped her delicate face, gazing into her amber eyes until her entire face flushed, and her lovely eyes shyly looked away. Then, he gently, passionately kissed her.\n\nWe are not lambs on the altar. Feeling the sweet, intoxicating fragrance on his tongue, Juan was certain. We have given love and received love, deep, intense, and enduring love. That is everything. Love is the most beautiful human emotion. When two hearts, after a long journey, finally come together, no matter the faith or differences, every beat says: I will never leave you! Then, love has quietly arrived, and no force can tear them apart!"

DD_ASU_22_d: "'Moors, go home!' Several children surrounded a Moorish girl, throwing dirty mud at her tender face. In this 'war game' they boasted of, the Moorish girl just knelt on the ground, holding a rag doll tightly to her chest, silently letting the mud stain her black hair.\n\n'Ouch!' Suddenly, a few stones flew, and the previously triumphant 'crusaders' immediately fled in disarray. 'Tch, bullies.' A blond boy walked out from behind a tree, curling his lips in disdain. 'Are you okay?'\n\nFacing the boy's outstretched hand, the girl just timidly raised her eyes, shrinking back a bit, wrinkling the doll in her arms. Helplessly scratching his soft golden hair, the boy gently piled the stones in his hand on the ground. 'Let's build a little house! With these branches and stones.'\n\n'I... I'm dirty...' The little girl unconsciously lowered her head again, letting her mud-stained black hair fall, covering her eyes. 'What's dirty?' The boy directly reached out, his slender fingers gently brushing aside the girl's bangs, revealing a pair of amber, shy, and lovely eyes like a rabbit. As if bewitched, the girl just stared blankly at the boy's hand passing through her hair, her amber eyes meeting the boy's sincere and clear gem-like eyes.\n\n'Aren't we all the same?' The boy smiled gently, the cool evening breeze slightly lifting his golden hair, also gently brushing the girl's bangs. The starry sky above painted a beautiful picture in the twilight, but the girl had no time to care about the stars behind the boy. Her beating heart was entirely captivated by the boy's shining eyes."

DD_ASU_23_t: "Walking Alone in the Cold Rain"
DD_ASU_23_d: "Holding a jet-black umbrella in one hand and a bouquet of white flowers in the other, Juan slowly moved through the relentless cold rain. The broad, dark brim of his hat obscured the upper part of his face. The dreary rain was like an endless prison, locking both the wandering spirits of the past and the man lost in the present within memories of bygone days. The pouring rain was an impenetrable wall, impossible to pass through or escape.\n\nA cold wind swept across the rain-soaked wasteland, making Juan shiver, his stubble trembling. As he aged, the cold and rain felt like icy arrows piercing deep into his flesh. He approached a solitary grave, its tombstone standing alone in the desolate field, the inscription barely legible. Juan gently placed the white flowers on the grave, tenderly, as if wiping away tears from someone's eyes.\n\nUnnoticed, the black umbrella slipped from his hand. Juan removed his hat, holding it to his chest, revealing his slightly graying blond hair, faded like clothes washed too many times. The icy rain fell on him, seeping into his sleeves and sliding down his face. The raindrops that trickled from the corners of his eyes carried a hint of warmth."
DD_ASU_23a: "Christians and Moors, will they never understand each other?"
DD_ASU_24_t: "The Fate of the Knights"
DD_ASU_24_d: "The religious and military orders serving God are the core force and backbone of our Reconquista. They receive aid from our monarchs, reclaim lost territories for the kingdom, and fight against the heathens. Unlike the three great orders that roam the entire Catholic world and act independently in the Holy Land, most of the military orders in Iberia directly follow the orders of the monarch, under our direct control.\n\nNow, the great cause of the Reconquista has been completed, God's servants have retaken the land that belonged to us from the despicable enemies of Christ, and the status of the knights has become微妙 again. Without a theological target to crusade against, the role of the knights as a military order has become obscure.

The remnants of the Moors have been completely expelled, but they left behind a considerable legacy. After the local Muslim landowners and peasants were driven out, a large amount of unclaimed land in the south was left for us to develop. We have authorized the nobility to enclose these unclaimed lands, turning them into their own estates.\n\nIn this process, some converted Moors may have been mistakenly identified as infidels who should be stripped of their land, causing some discontent and chaos in our territory. The noble landowners who gained large tracts of land through the enclosure movement quickly rose to become a troublesome force influencing our kingdom. The forced conversion of arable land into pastures by these landowners led to a significant reduction in grain production, dealing a heavy blow to the national economy and agriculture."

The bishops of the newly established dioceses in the south have been quite critical of the kingdom's lenient religious policies, leading to constant friction with our government in local governance.\n\nThis has caused us considerable trouble in political and diplomatic relations within the Catholic world, as the Reconquista was initially waged under the banner of a holy war. Many Christians have spontaneously engaged in violent actions against local Moors, leading to ongoing social unrest. Rome has also condemned our tolerance and inaction towards infidels, accusing us of defiling Christ's land."

Enrique, recognized by the old emperor for his military achievements, was like a dazzling comet, while Carlos, the eldest son, saw him as a thorn in his side. Enrique's lowly bloodline and his status, which did not match his identity, led Carlos to constantly provoke this hot-tempered young man.\n\nAlfonso, watching the two brothers arguing endlessly, couldn't help but feel a headache coming on. By the time he arrived, the two were already red-faced from their quarrel.\n\n'You lowly bastard, if it weren't for the emperor's mercy, you would never have set foot in the palace!' Enrique, looking at the man's mocking expression, placed his hand on the hilt of his sword and retorted, 'Better than a good-for-nothing playboy. Have you learned nothing but the art of drinking and whoring as you've aged?'\n\n'You bastard,' Carlos's face turned red with anger, 'Do you want to test the sharpness of my sword?'\n\n'My sword is no less sharp!'\n\n'Enough, this is the palace!' Alfonso placed his hand on both their swords, stopping this all-too-common farce. Watching the guards escort the two away, Alfonso couldn't help but ponder his own future. What will tomorrow bring?

Carlos bowed his head in fear, instinctively afraid of this somewhat unfamiliar middle-aged man. The last time he remembered seeing his father was during his childhood. Back then, the innocent boy with a bright smile looked up curiously at the father he didn't know well. Now, he simply lowered his head, intertwining his hands in front of him.\n\n'Forget it, just listen carefully.' His father calmly shifted his gaze back, continuing in his low, monotonous voice. 'Listen well, as a monarch...' Carlos stared blankly at his father's face, at the distinct lines and graying temples. Compared to the last time he saw him, his father had indeed aged. He truly didn't understand the man before him. He was the emperor of all Spain, and he was busy. He loved his country, he loved his people, he loved his son... even though he was busy. So he indulged himself, until he could no longer do so.\n\nBut that day seemed to be approaching relentlessly, approaching this man and his country. Carlos knew he could never become a great monarch like his father, but at the very least, he must not become the one who destroys his father's life's work."

The noble man gently raised his hand to interrupt the old man. 'For a kingdom as harsh and capricious as ours, such terms are indeed hard to believe, right? But at least in my domain, I can ensure your interests. As the Prince of León, your rightful interests will naturally be protected, as long as... your community remains loyal to me.'\n\nThe old man looked at the confident and elegant prince, at the guards standing respectfully on either side of the door. He stood up slowly and bowed to the prince. 'Your Highness,' Muhammad lowered his head, avoiding direct eye contact, 'We are willing to offer you our loyalty.'

An empire spanning oceans and seas spreads Spanish civilization and the radiance of the sun to uncivilized lands, proclaiming the greatness of God and the truth of His faith in His name.\n\nThe empire's frontiers shift with the reach of our fleets, expanding every week, every day, every minute, and every second into the unknown. Once, we were pitiful figures mocked by other Christians, locked in a deadly struggle with Muslims for control of Iberia. Now, no European power can match our influence, and no one in the world can rival us. The glory of Spain is with God, like the sun that never sets over our territories that encompass half the world.\n\nYet, the conquest of the New World is far from over. More unknown frontiers and wealth await brave and diligent Spaniards to explore and claim. Our destiny is to expand endlessly in the name of God, sailing to even farther horizons."

The royal government's council has successfully integrated colonial affairs, domestic affairs, and economic affairs into one body. In addition to advising the king, it also takes on the responsibility of directly issuing the king's orders to various provincial governors.\n\nThe new council is mainly composed of the king's direct advisors and administrative ministers, eliminating the irrelevant idlers who often existed in the past. The Spanish council system has now become an efficient and incorruptible administrative body, whose members fully obey the will of the king and God, and can propose specific solutions in a timely manner no matter what happens.\n\nNevertheless, although the council has supreme power, it is still subject to the king. That is to say, if the king is incompetent, this council system could become a burden. Of course, there is a very simple solution: let the council have more power than the king..."

Perhaps no empire, except for the Roman Empire, can compare to the current Spanish Empire. However, even the Roman Empire never possessed such vast territories and colonies, nor such abundant and endless wealth.\n\nThe glory of God was once lost to us during the Moorish invasions and the internal divisions of Christian kingdoms. Yet, it was always there, whether by day or by night, the light of the sun or the stars would illuminate the path through the endless darkness. With unwavering faith, believing that God's power would help us overcome the heathens and all other obstacles, we ultimately achieved great success. From the rugged mountains of the north to the winding rivers of the south, the heathens have been eradicated, and our victory is glorious and eternal.\n\nAfter unifying Iberia, we began a century-long journey of exploration and expansion. Whether it was the gold, sugarcane, and cocoa of the Americas, the ivory of Africa, the diamonds and spices of India, or the porcelain of China, these once-rare treasures are now monopolized by our invincible fleet, leaving other Christian nations envious. Our wealth is endless, our power grows stronger every day, and we do not know what outcome God has prepared for us in the future full of possibilities. But we believe that He has created a great era for the devout Spanish faithful, granting us courage and faith, and forging an eternal glory."

Below, the tombstone bore the name and praises of the former King of Asturias, 'Emperor of All Spain, the Great Lord Forever Blessed by God, Father of Iberia, Charles I.'\n\nThe king raised the red wine in his right hand, filled the glass in his left, but hesitated to bring it to his lips. He stood before his father, just as he had decades ago, nervously standing before his father's throne, both eager and fearful, imagining how his father would address him.\n\nDecades have passed like a fleeting dream. The once dashing playboy now bears the marks of time. He is no longer young, his once smooth face now weathered by state affairs. He can no longer see his father's gentle, angry, helpless, or proud face. He recalls a childhood afternoon when his father held his small hand, walking through a garden bathed in warm sunlight. Back then, he had not yet achieved greatness, nor had disaster struck. All he remembers is the gentle breeze and the perfect sunlight.\n\nCharles II poured the wine from his right hand onto the cold stone floor, then drank the wine in his left hand in one gulp.

If you honor the privileges you promised us, we will defend you to the death.'\n\nAlfonso shook his head, 'Do you think I don't know, Muhammad? Should I count the number of letters you've exchanged with the Maghreb?'\n\n'Your Majesty, you must know that it doesn't matter who rules this country, right? It will always be us who control it!' Everyone laughed, filling the hall with a lively atmosphere.\n\n'How many others share his thoughts?' Alfonso continued to swirl his glass nonchalantly.

Today, he was invited by the newly established Inquisition to observe their work.\n\nSoon, he arrived at a converted church where all Moors who refused to submit to God would be judged by the priests, with most sentenced to burn.\n\nThis brave and fearsome warrior king had always despised formalities. His impatience and temper were well-known. After sitting in the church for a while, he grew restless and, to the shock of his guards, stood up and walked toward the kneeling Moors.\n\nIn full view, Enrique drew his sword and skillfully beheaded a Moor. The sound of the head rolling echoed in the silent church, and everyone held their breath.\n\n'You only need to do one thing: use the ashes of heathens to appease God's authority. Can't you even light a fire?' Enrique roared at the priests, ignoring their explanations. He sheathed his sword and strode out of the church.\n\nThe guards hurried after him, and the priests were left in panic, unsure of what to do.

'Sir,' Abdul felt the scorching blood burning in his trachea, the twilight like layers of boiling blood mist, turning into searing silver needles piercing his lungs. 'I beg you—I beg you! Please spare my innocent wife and children!'\n\nThe soldier with a cross embroidered on his chest sneered at the man before him, staring at his blood and dust-covered face. He raised his foot and mercilessly stomped his head into the sand. 'I told you, vile Moor! We just didn't have the time to deal with you before.' He lifted his foot and kicked the half-dead body aside. 'Now that we've stabilized the situation, of course, we'll root out you vermin.'

Given the unexpected influx of silver from the Americas in the following decades, the use of the 'Eight Real' silver coin surged, and it soon became widely known as the 'Spanish Dollar.'
