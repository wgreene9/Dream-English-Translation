DD_ML1_1_t: "Shadows of the Past"
DD_ML1_1_d: "Ferdinando watched nervously and strangely as the Muslim fleet approached his merchant ship. Their masts bore the flag of the Arab Empire, a symbol that had long been swept into the corners of history along with the glory of the Arabs. These Arab pirates, dressed as if they were soldiers of the true Caliph, boarded Ferdinando's deck. The leading man, dressed in luxurious attire, bowed gracefully and spoke to him in fluent Spanish.\n\n'Excuse our intrusion, sir. We are the Mallorca detachment of the Arab Imperial Navy, here to inspect your cargo.' Ferdinando stared dumbfounded at these soldiers who acted as if they owned his ship. It took him a while to realize that these were pirates under the banner of the long-dead, orthodox Caliphate. But at least they were nostalgic. A gang of polite thugs, a fleet from the past; a group of outlaws under the name of an empire... or perhaps shadows clinging to the dreams of old."

Busy sailors were working hard at their posts, making final preparations for departure. The unfurled sails swayed in the breeze, billowing in layers; the dark cannons lay quietly on either side of the ship, emitting a faint smell of gunpowder.\n\nFor the principle of Islamic equality, the followers of the Kharijite sect had never given up their struggle. From Mesopotamia to the Balearics, the Arab Imperial Navy, loyal to the sacred and only true Caliph, wandered between the cracks of centuries and history. Not yielding to tyranny, not submitting to sin, a just and elected Caliph would eventually lead the faithful to reclaim what was rightfully his."

DD_ML1_3_t: "Rebuilding the Imperial Governorate"
DD_ML1_3_d: "In the long river of fate, the empire stands like a stone tablet carrying ancient memories, quietly enduring the tides of time. Our ancestors once stirred a nameless storm across the empire's lands, challenging the Abbasid rule with faith and fire. But the storm was eventually crushed under the empire's iron hooves, their banners broken, rivers of blood flowed, and our people were driven to the ends of the earth, the Balearic Islands.\n\nToday, we have never witnessed the glory and failure of our ancestors' uprising. All we know is a memory eroded by sea winds and saltwater, an ancient rope that tightly binds the empire's remnants to that lost land. As night falls, the moonlight's blade pierces through the waves, resting on the shore. The shadows of our ancestors emerge from the moonlight, silently recounting the forgotten vision—the once-collapsed governorate system, the once-lost territories. The bright light is obscured by clouds, the turbulent waves gradually calm, and the stones in the sea stand firm on the beach, polished smooth and hard by the tides of time, yet never sinking.\n\nLife in the Balearics is long. A seemingly scattered pirate fleet roams the Mediterranean waves, learning from the sea and the wind. Great achievements are not made overnight. Each raid is a precise probe, training the silent advance of the maritime army; each retreat is a tempering, honing the fleet like a hidden sword, waiting for the destined moment.\n\nThat moment has finally come, with the twists of historical fate. The lost governorate system, like a reef exposed after the tide recedes, will be the first step in rebuilding our former glory. From here, we will embark on the path of conquest to restore the peaceful Islamic world."

The sea breeze howls from the depths of the Mediterranean, as if recounting the fate and glory of the Arabs. Once, we were mere exiles from afar, carrying the tattered banners of the former empire, drifting among the waves of the Balearic Islands. Now, our gaze has crossed the sea, etched onto the fertile lands of Andalusia.\n\nThe sunlight spills over the towering mosques and squares, the walls of Al-Andalus seem to tremble, perhaps with joy for the new life. Conquest does not merely mean occupying land, but allowing this land to shine with a unique brilliance under a new order; we are not simply bringing Andalusia under iron-fisted rule, but refining it into a new nation, giving it a new identity—the Governorate of Al-Andalus. On the ancient roads of Córdoba, travelers once again hear the bells of caravans, the markets are once again filled with the scent of spices, and knowledge and faith flourish once more on this land.\n\nTime will settle everything, and the name of the Arabs will become an indelible mark in the history of this land, like the never-ceasing tides of the Mediterranean. The Governorate of Al-Andalus is the first symbol of the empire's revival, a vow to the future, that we will create a new era founded on wisdom, patience, and courage—the golden age of Islam."

Our Arab empire is not, as the Christians hoped, forever buried in the grave. On the contrary, our magnificent fleet has once again appeared on the distant horizon, announcing the return of the imperial navy in the terrified eyes of the Christians.\n\nWe execute those priests who sing lies and commit heinous deeds, we distribute the luxuries from the papal palace to those Christians who willingly convert, and we plunder the greatest spoils of the church's sins—their ill-gotten gains, the papal treasury.\n\nThis city, soon to be purified, will become the new governorate. Warriors from the Balearics swarm in, plotting the revenge of the Kharijites. Soon, we will cross the sea to reclaim the lands once occupied by the false Caliphs and rebuild our great and pure empire. The great nation of the Arabs has never gone away; we have always been drifting on the endless blue sea."

Here, our pioneers spread the teachings to the local nomadic tribes in the desert oases, uniting them under the banner of the one true God, resisting the oppression of the false Caliphate. However, these dynasties were but short-lived, confined to remote corners.\n\nLacking strong guidance, the believers were forced to submit once again to the power of the false Caliphs or flee into the desert, disappearing without a trace. Now, we return in glory, carrying centuries of resentment and hatred towards the usurpers, offering the glory of victory to Allah, and bringing the dawn of hope to all who have suffered. We will rebuild the governorate of the Prophet's empire in the Maghreb, restoring the unity and glory of the Islamic world.\n\nThe reconquest of the Maghreb is just the beginning. We will not forget our brothers who once stirred waves of struggle across the empire—Egypt, the Levant, Persia, and even distant Khorasan and Transoxiana. The flames of the Kharijites will surely burn in the east and west. We will rebuild an equal Arab empire for every Muslim, from sunrise to sunset, every inch of land.

Unlike Roman tyranny, we abolished harsh taxes, allowed Egyptians to retain their religious beliefs, and Cairo, built by the Fatimids, remains one of the most prosperous cities in the world.\n\nThe Crusaders' invasion shattered the peace along the Nile. These barbaric Latins plundered and killed freely on Muslim lands. The declining Ayyubid dynasty could not resist them, maintaining only a fragile peace through humiliating marriages.\n\nBut now, we have reversed this. After overthrowing the corrupt Ayyubid dynasty, we will establish a new Egypt under the leadership of the Kharijites, achieving equality and democracy. Our relationship with the Crusader states has also reversed—Allah's wrath will soon descend upon the sinful kingdoms built by Christian scoundrels."

The dry wind rasped past them, casting a glance before dispersing into the boundless wilderness.\n\nThe man walking at the back stopped, looking up at the sunlight silently pouring from the sky onto the land called Arabia. He took a deep drink from his water flask. 'Sand is still better than waves and storms,' he murmured in a low, deep voice. 'I'm old, these old bones have fought the sea for a lifetime, it's time to rest.' He looked around, as if gazing at the sea as he did in his youth, but there were no shimmering waves, only endless sand blowing in the wind.\n\nThe young guide ahead also stopped his camel, looking with interest at this 'old man' in his forties. His eyes were still sharp, his face still resolute, but somehow, a trace of weariness had crept onto his straight back. The young guide turned away. 'You're a strange one,' he said with a smile. 'You have quite the entourage, but nowadays, noblemen are all rushing to make fortunes at sea, yet you've come to this godforsaken place.' He deftly took the reins. 'You say this is your homeland, yet you need a foreigner like me to guide you. Well, just ahead is the place you mentioned, better hurry if you want to enter the city.'\n\nThe well-dressed man still said nothing, silently gazing at the distant shadows.

The Syrians only wanted to survive in this cruel, blood-soaked world, nothing more.\n\nThe convoy stopped at the half-ruined governor's mansion. The local guide silently watched the young nobleman, who had just inherited his family's wealth, jump out of the carriage and look around at the desolate scene. Everyone was silent.\n\n'Sir, this is already...' He was ready to endure cold sarcasm and complaints. But before he could finish, the honorable Emir seemed to have discovered some priceless treasure, waved him off, and bent down.\n\nA rose, bathed in the first light of dawn, bloomed with dew in this near-ruined wilderness. Once, such roses had bloomed wildly in the fertile fields of Damascus, the sky clear and blue, birds singing softly, the river flowing quietly.

Without hesitation, Ibrahim stuffed the heavy iron ball into the cannon. The fierce sea wind filled every sail of the Menorcan fleet, and the rapidly sailing ships rose and fell on the waves, the splashing tides washing over the deck and slapping the sailors' faces. 'Fire!'\n\nThe enemy fleet gradually closed in, and a dense volley of cannon fire landed on the starboard side, raising a towering curtain of water. The Christian red-striped flags fluttered on the enemy's masts, glaring through the misty water curtain. 'Enemy on the starboard! Hard to starboard, hard to starboard!' The rain-like cannon fire stirred up columns of water, and through the smoke and mist, the Menorcan ships broke through the waves like charging knights, heading straight for the Christian ships.\n\n'Prepare for impact!' Ibrahim nearly gritted his teeth, and with a tremendous shock and the screeching sound of twisting metal, the Menorcan sea knights collided directly with the enemy ship. 'Draw your swords and board!'

It was also the tenth year since he converted to the Kharijite sect. Although he was already over fifty when he joined the army, after his conversion, it seemed as if he had been blessed by Allah and granted a second, vibrant life.\n\n'Young sir? Are you the family of a true believer warrior?'\n\nAbdullah looked slightly surprised at the stranger who spoke to him in somewhat broken Arabic. The man had dark skin, wore a common dark green robe, and held a blue fish-shaped ornament.\n\n'Please allow me to give this to you. It is an amulet from our Amazigh people, and it will protect you and your family.'\n\n'Thank you...' Abdullah took it with both hands, feeling its exquisite material and craftsmanship. The Amazigh man then led his camel, laden with spices, silk, and pearls, towards the market.\n\nBefore the Imperial Navy arrived, Abdullah had rarely seen these exotic items from distant lands, brought to Palermo by merchants. He had only occasionally seen them on the bodies of Christian nobles who liked to show off on the streets. Now, these once-precious goods were increasingly circulating in the local market and were quite popular.\n\nIt wasn't until a pair of old but strong hands patted his shoulder that Abdullah snapped out of his reverie. He turned to see his father, who had safely returned home, his face filled with pride.

When he joined the glorious war of the true faith at fourteen, no one could have predicted that this seemingly frail and thin young man would possess such unwavering will and faith, as well as exceptional intelligence and courage. He had repeatedly turned the tide in battles where the true believers were at a disadvantage or even in dire straits, leading his comrades to safety.\n\nAlthough the battles he experienced were not large in scale, the higher-ups in the army had noticed the young man's potential, more valuable than the gold of the West Sudan, and saw the brilliant future of this devout warrior of Allah.\n\n'Have I met you before?' Abdullah, stepping off the warship, looked slightly puzzled at the young man who seemed to be his age. His dark green robe looked familiar, and his dark skin stirred Abdullah's memories.\n\n'Allow me to pay my respects, honorable true believer warrior. You once wore the amulet my father gave you.' Abdullah immediately understood the young man's identity and instinctively reached for his chest, where the exquisite fish-shaped amulet had once hung before it fell into the sea during a naval battle.\n\n'How is your father?'\n'He is well. As a merchant, he must travel frequently.'\n'Then what brings you to me?' The young Amazigh man opened his hands, revealing an almost identical amulet, and placed it in Abdullah's hands.\n\n'My father told me about you, especially after your deeds spread, the entire population of Palermo felt immense pride and honored the peace and prosperity you and the other warriors brought.'\n'Thank you.'\n\nAmidst the cheers of the crowd, Abdullah left the port.
