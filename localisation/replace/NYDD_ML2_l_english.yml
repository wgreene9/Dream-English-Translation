However, their leader, Klaus Störtebeker, and his crew were eventually cornered on Heligoland by the oppressors of the Nordic nations, meeting their fateful end.\n\nNow, the tides have turned.

Thorfinn grew up on his father's ship, his childhood filled with turbulent seas and distant adventures, laying a solid foundation for his future as a skilled pirate sailor. In Visby, a place steeped in ancient pirate spirit, every breath he took seemed to absorb the wisdom and courage of his ancestors. Before the age of eleven, Thorfinn followed his father in raiding villages along the Baltic coast and merchant ships at sea, a life he saw as both a traditional inheritance and the ordinary way of life for Gotlanders. However, this all came to an abrupt end when his father was betrayed and murdered by his former friend, Askeladd. Thorfinn's world was turned upside down. Filled with a burning desire for revenge, he decided to go incognito, following his father's killer, Askeladd, biding his time to avenge his father.\n\nFor four years, Thorfinn silently observed and learned on Askeladd's ship, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. His heart, like the cold sea, appeared calm on the surface but churned with hidden currents. Finally, during a chaotic battle in the northern waters of Riga, Thorfinn found his opportunity. In the midst of the fray, using his deep understanding of ships and combat, he stabbed Askeladd in the back with his father's dagger. In that moment, he not only avenged his father but also took over Askeladd's ship and crew, beginning a new chapter in his pirate career.\n\nOver time, however, Thorfinn grew dissatisfied with his mundane pirate life. He began to crave greater power and influence, desiring to shape the fate of Gotland and even the entire Baltic. With five years of connections and experience at sea, Thorfinn decided to run for the leadership of Gotland's pirates, a competition only the most cunning and powerful could win.\n\nIn the following years, Thorfinn demonstrated his extraordinary strategy and ruthless tactics. Through schemes, assassinations, bribes, and threats, he eliminated his rivals one by one, ultimately claiming the position of leader of the Gotland Pirate Republic."

Even amidst the flames of war, Malta's cornflowers bloom freely. This pure and beautiful heart of the sea, this unyielding land where cornflowers bloom, this serene and peaceful scenery, will now be revealed for us. The island of Malta, a hub of Mediterranean trade, will become our base for future raids in the Mediterranean. Malta's cornflowers will bloom for us."

From this vantage point outside the church, he can see soldiers running back and forth through the opulent district, ruthlessly tearing apart captives, setting buildings ablaze, and leaving with piles of loot. Hours ago, the lower levels were a sea of flames; now, only the choking smell of thick smoke and the sounds of conflict from the last few skirmishes remain. The City of the World's Desire has been reduced to a smoldering shell, and the legendary Miklagard has been tamed by the Varangians who were once employed by it. The king turns back to the gilded doors of the Hagia Sophia and strides in triumphantly, his followers scattering to strip away the mosaics and other decorations. Everyone wonders: why did the Greeks worship a god who abandoned them in their most desperate hour? But it doesn't matter, really. The ancient gods will rule these halls from now on."

string_start_ML2: "Gotland, an isolated maritime nation in the Baltic Sea, became part of the kingdom as a vassal of Sweden during the 11th and early 12th centuries. Under the leadership of §YKing Karl§!, who was crowned by §YEdgar the Ætheling of England§!, English clergy flooded into this traditional Norse kingdom. However, for Gotland, which flies its flag over the White Sea, the island has always been a deeply rooted Norse stronghold, rarely penetrated or influenced by Christianity.\n\nIn the following half-century, during the turbulent era later known as the §YNorthern Crusades§!, the Kingdom of Sweden sought to spread the glory of God and the king across the Scandinavian Peninsula. Captives and refugees of the traditional faith continuously poured in. The kingdom's grip and legal control over this sea grew increasingly lax and ineffective. In the chaotic centuries that followed, §YErik the Griffin§!, a Danish rebel general from the Wendish coast, led his fleet and rallied pirates from across the Baltic. With the help of traditional Norse allies within Visby, he captured Gotland and declared himself Admiral of the Fleet. Mercenaries, outlaws, refugees, and adventurers from all over Scandinavia flocked to this free city. In this era of chaos, Gotland became the new master of the White Sea, renowned across the seas as the Black Flag Alliance, striking fear into the hearts of merchants from all nations.\n\nHowever, as the fires of war gradually died down and order was slowly restored, the Nordic kingdoms began to solidify their footing, and Gotland's regime appeared increasingly precarious. Rulers of various nations yearned to obliterate this den of detestable outlaws that threatened their coasts, bringing Gotland under their royal authority. The Pirate League's forces were forced to retreat from the entire northern seas to the vicinity of Gotland Island. Surrounded by enemies, will the captains of Visby face the end of their era, or will they lead the Black Flag Alliance to even greater seas? It is time for the entire North, for all sailors upon the ocean, to understand who truly is the §YUncrowned King§! of the Seven Seas. The free harbor will shelter the brave who fear no storm."
