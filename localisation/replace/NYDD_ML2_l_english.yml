DD_ML2_1_t:"The Old Captain"
DD_ML2_1_d:"Unlike his lawless subordinates, 'Red-Hair' Bjørn is not a native Ibizan sailor. This aged captain hails from a Norse family in the Danelaw. His father was taken to Valhalla by the Valkyries during an invasion of England, and the young Bjørn made a living on the docks as a pickpocket and ship's cook until the day he was caught stealing. After killing a man and seizing his wealth, he was forced to flee aboard a merchant ship bound for the Mediterranean.\n\nIt turned out that Bjørn was a sailor of exceptional talent and a natural-born criminal. Through his superb seamanship and a temper as fiery as his hair, he rose through the ranks on the merchant vessel to become first mate. He eventually threw the captain and any crew unwilling to follow him overboard, taking command of the ship to prowl the Mediterranean, raiding coastal monasteries and merchant ships of other faiths.\n\nUltimately, these notorious desperadoes assembled a formidable fleet. Relying on Bjørn's innate leadership and his Viking blood, he unified the pirates of Ibiza under his banner. Now, 'Red-Hair' Bjørn is over sixty years old; the fiery red has faded from his crown, turned to ashes, replaced by a silvery white. This old pirate, whom the sailors call 'the Old Captain,' rarely leads the fleet to sea anymore. Instead, he remains on the island of Ibiza, ruling his seas like a king."
DD_ML2_1a:"But I am still the King of the Seven Seas!"
DD_ML2_1a_modifier:"Norse Legacy"
desc_DD_ML2_1a_modifier:"When asked why there are so many sailors, we can only shrug helplessly and say, 'Because we're pirates, you fool.'"

DD_ML2_2_t:"A New Face"
DD_ML2_2_d:"'Lads, do you want to become nobles?' When First Mate Harald heard these words drift from the Old Captain's mouth, pipe clenched between his teeth, he was puzzling over the charts spread on the table. 'Hmm? What? Boss, what did you say?' The second and third mates seated around the table exchanged bewildered glances. The second mate's right eye patch, covering an empty socket, hung loose and almost slipped off. 'What? Nobles? Us? What kind of nobles?'\n\nThe Old Captain didn't bother repeating his foolish words, merely blowing a lazy smoke ring. 'The Balearics are big enough, and my fleet is strong enough. Once we conquer those lands, I will be King of Mallorca, and you will be Dukes of Mallorca. Those cowards will be our serfs. Wealth, power, a place to call home—we'll have everything the lads want.'\n\nHarald stared at his captain, dumbfounded, listening to him talk about laws and lordship. His bushy beard trembled slightly with his slightly agape mouth—"
DD_ML2_2a:"'Aye, lads. My word will be the new law, the new order.'"
DD_ML2_2a_tt:"§Y[Root.GetName]§! can use the province interaction '§YPirate Haven§!', located in the §Mupper right corner§! of the province interface.\n(§gIf not present, please check MOD compatibility)§!\n"

DD_ML2_3_t:"Sunset on the Western Shore"
DD_ML2_3_d:"Bjørn has bedded countless women in his lifetime, from brothel prostitutes and captured peasant women to wealthy noble ladies. The Old Captain himself has lost track of how many children he has sired, but only two left a deep impression. One was his daughter with a Sicilian nun; her mother was eventually driven to hang herself in poverty and despair. Seeking revenge, this girl disguised herself as a boy and sneaked onto his ship. After hiding in plain sight for three years, he personally slit her throat—the cost was half of Bjørn's palm.\n\nThe second child was a boy borne by his last woman. He was placed in a fishing village near Barcelona, with money and supplies sent monthly. Bjørn is old. He is no longer the wild man who commanded wind and waves. This raven, who once fervently followed Odin like his fathers, has grown weary of wandering. The Norse faith is fading, and the order and tradition of Christianity are replacing the old era, the era of Pirate Bjørn. Now, this tired old man merely wishes to leave something behind for his bloodline, for himself in this world.\n\nKilling, plundering, fleeing. Now with silver temples, Bjørn is weary of his life—he is tired. Recalling the dusk when he first raised a sail, that red-haired boy sitting on the dock, watching the sun sink far into the blue sea—what was in his heart then?"
DD_ML2_3a:"He will never remember. The Captain's blood has cooled."

DD_ML2_4_t:"Tainted Blood"
DD_ML2_4_d:"Before descending into a life of piracy and wickedness, Harald once bore a distinguished surname. He was born into an ancient family in Oslo, Norway, a young lord of noble blood—until he murdered his own father and elder brother and was cast out by his family in the ensuing frantic flight. Mocked by nobles, spat upon by commoners, even third-rate poets in cheap taverns derisively sang of him as 'Tainted Blood'.\n\nNever. He would never endure such humiliation, nor accept this farce in Ibiza. True, he desires to be a noble again, but not like this—not by watching this troupe of pretentious clowns take the stage, calling themselves nobles. Moreover, a king? Lords? Laws? Harald has cast these things, along with his family name, into the depths of the sea. And now, a bunch of pirates are to reverently fish them back up? No. Having abandoned order, he will never be bound by it again in this lifetime."
DD_ML2_4a:"Harald may be fallen, but he will never acknowledge this kind of 'redemption'."
DD_ML2_5_t:"Icy Rain and Raging Waves"

DD_ML2_5_d:"Bjørn stood alone at the bow, coldly eyeing the pirates surrounding him with weapons raised. A frigid downpour hammered the dark sea, whipping up towering waves in the gale that crashed against the flagship's hull, making the overburdened wooden masts groan and creak. 'Is this all of you?' The Old Captain sneered at the shivering sailors who dared not advance. 'You think this rabble can defy your Captain?!'\n\nAmid a crack of thunder, Bjørn whipped his cutlass from its sheath with a flash, causing the cowering pirates to recoil another step. But a blond man stepped forward from the crowd, and the pirates immediately closed in again. The Old Captain narrowed his eyes, truly appraising his first mate for the first time. 'Harald...'\n\nHarald, like a true noble, drew his rapier and executed a perfect flourish. 'Nobles, nobles... Old Captain, do you want to be a noble so badly? We are murderers, scum, criminals, rogues, brigands, and scoundrels—but we are not, by any means, fucking nobles!' He stared mockingly and pityingly at the old man before him, leveling his sword point at his captain. 'True nobility comes from inborn, exalted blood, not from the whimsical fancies of mud-wallowing fools. You wish to bind a pirate's freedom with order?'\n\n'You have grown far too old, "Old Captain."'"
DD_ML2_5a:"The pirates surged forward like a tide, overwhelming their captain."

DD_ML2_6_t:"Pirate Haven"
DD_ML2_6_d:"After clearing out our former comrades in the surrounding area, the Balearic Islands are now firmly under our control. These neighboring isles will serve as the base for our plundering enterprise in the Mediterranean, becoming a renowned—or rather, infamous—pirate haven. We have named this new pirate confederation Vikingahofn, meaning 'Harbor of the Vikings.'"
DD_ML2_6a:"A toast to our future!"

DD_ML2_7_t:"Sea of Thieves"
DD_ML2_7_d:"Beyond the vast Mediterranean, across the distant ocean, lies a mysterious sea of freedom and opportunity. With the opening of new routes and the rise of exploration in the New World, more and more merchant ships and adventurers are setting sail westward. Slaves from Elysium and cargo bound for the New World have turned this sea of liberty into an El Dorado for us pirates.\n\nAs privateers and fugitives set foot on the soil of the New World, new pirate havens have been established in the Windward Islands. Perhaps we should shift the center of our rule to the New World, ride the tide of the times, and become the Pirate Kings of the New World. Rather than fighting tooth and nail against the well-prepared fleets of the Old World's princes, wouldn't it be better to plunder the countless merchant ships in the Caribbean!"
DD_ML2_7a1:"[486.GetName] lies at the heart of the storm."
DD_ML2_7a2:"[488.GetName] is the focal point of wealth."
DD_ML2_7a3:"I think [484.GetName] is more suitable."
DD_ML2_7a4:"[490.GetName] is better suited to become a pirate haven."
DD_ML2_7b:"Is it necessary?"
DD_ML2_7a_modifier:"New Pirate Haven"
desc_DD_ML2_7a_modifier:"Believe that tomorrow will be better."

DD_ML2_8_t:"Sailing Beyond Helheim"
DD_ML2_8_d:"The Pillars of Hercules, the Gateway to the Mediterranean, the landmark of Gibraltar. Our fleet passed through this narrow strait, sailing from the inner sea of Europa to distant realms beyond the Seven Seas. The Iberian winds billowed our sails, flapping loudly. The glorious fleet of [Root.GetName] sailed once again into this vast, boundless ocean, just like our forefathers.\n\nGibraltar shall become the chain by which we control the Mediterranean's throat. The seas beyond the Seven Seas shall also become our domain. We have sailed past the edge of the world, through storms and calamities, through the realms of death and destruction. Our fleet shall fear neither wind nor rain, neither trial nor challenge. Helheim, the realm of Hel, shall not open its gates for us; glory and crowns, the legends that roam the Seven Seas—we shall become the uncrowned kings of this great ocean!"

desc_DD_ML2_8n_into_the_beyond_modifier:"When we left our homeland, we resolved to follow our inborn spirit of adventure."

DD_ML2_9_t:"Jörmungandr, the World Serpent"
DD_ML2_9_d:"Iceland, a desolate isle at the edge of the world, a relic of volcanoes, its land covered in frozen tundra. Yet Iceland is not barren. The cod fisheries surrounding this island produce immense wealth. Moreover, Iceland is like a gateway to the old world, guarding the entrance to the sea routes between the New World and the Old Continent. Controlling this island means controlling half the trade routes to the New World, controlling half the New World's wealth.\n\nThis frozen island, bathed in the aurora, floats upon the bottomless deep sea that encircles the mortal realm. The old world and the distant New World are connected end to end through Iceland. Iceland places all vessels of the old world under the gaze of the glacial serpent. Now, if we wish, we can control the wealth of two worlds. Jörmungandr, slumbering beneath the endless sea, shall today raise colossal waves for us. The serpent encircling Midgard shall bring the wealth of the entire world under its control."
DD_ML2_9a:"Let the Serpent of the End bring forth great waves for us!"

#Let the glory and wealth of both worlds be ours!
DD_ML2_10_t:"King of the Seven Seas"
DD_ML2_10_d:"We are the tempest that sweeps the world, from the fringes of the Old Continent to every sea of the New World. While the nobles of the Old Continent foolishly assert their so-called claims of inheritance, we have forged a sovereignty upon the ocean. The Golden Age of Pirates has shattered the princes' illusions of ruling the seas. They will have to accept that the sea is a realm beyond the reach of law and order—it is the fear and nightmare etched into their very bones.\n\nDecades of blood and fire have dyed the sea into a Viking lake. While other lords still quarrel over barren fjord lands, the dragon-headed fleets have made coastal nations from the Seine to the Dnieper tremble in fear. Now, all notorious outlaws gather at our feet—not as vassals, but as a pack of wolves forever chasing the waves and plunder. Our name no longer belongs to any single family; it has become the thunder from beyond the horizon, the war cry of the raiders on the charge, the one and only law upon the Seven Seas."
DD_ML2_10a:"Let the wolfpack run on!"

DD_ML2_11_t:"Sacking Miklagard"
DD_ML2_11_d:"[Root.Monarch.GetName] stood before the Hagia Sophia, savoring the beauty and tranquility of the surroundings, while chaos reigned in the streets below. From this vantage point outside the cathedral, he could see soldiers darting back and forth through the opulent districts, ruthlessly tearing apart captives, setting buildings ablaze, and departing with armfuls of plunder. Hours earlier, the lower city had been an inferno; now, only the acrid stench of billowing smoke mingled with the sounds of conflict from the last few pockets of minor skirmishes. The City of the World's Desire had been reduced to a smoldering husk; the legendary Miklagard was now tamed by the Varangians who had once been in its employ. [Root.Monarch.GetName] turned back to the gilded doors of the Hagia Sophia and strode inside triumphantly. His attendants fanned out, dismantling mosaics and other ornaments. Everyone wondered: why did the Greeks worship a god who had abandoned them in their most desperate hour? But it didn't really matter. The Old Gods would now rule these halls."

Thorfinn grew up on his father's ship, his childhood filled with turbulent seas and distant adventures, laying a solid foundation for his future as a skilled pirate sailor. In Visby, a place steeped in ancient pirate spirit, every breath he took seemed to absorb the wisdom and courage of his ancestors. Before the age of eleven, Thorfinn followed his father in raiding villages along the Baltic coast and merchant ships at sea, a life he saw as both a traditional inheritance and the ordinary way of life for Gotlanders. However, this all came to an abrupt end when his father was betrayed and murdered by his former friend, Askeladd. Thorfinn's world was turned upside down. Filled with a burning desire for revenge, he decided to go incognito, following his father's killer, Askeladd, biding his time to avenge his father.\n\nFor four years, Thorfinn silently observed and learned on Askeladd's ship, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. His heart, like the cold sea, appeared calm on the surface but churned with hidden currents. Finally, during a chaotic battle in the northern waters of Riga, Thorfinn found his opportunity. In the midst of the fray, using his deep understanding of ships and combat, he stabbed Askeladd in the back with his father's dagger. In that moment, he not only avenged his father but also took over Askeladd's ship and crew, beginning a new chapter in his pirate career.\n\nOver time, however, Thorfinn grew dissatisfied with his mundane pirate life. He began to crave greater power and influence, desiring to shape the fate of Gotland and even the entire Baltic. With five years of connections and experience at sea, Thorfinn decided to run for the leadership of Gotland's pirates, a competition only the most cunning and powerful could win.\n\nIn the following years, Thorfinn demonstrated his extraordinary strategy and ruthless tactics. Through schemes, assassinations, bribes, and threats, he eliminated his rivals one by one, ultimately claiming the position of leader of the Gotland Pirate Republic."

# string_start_ML2: "Gotland, an isolated maritime nation in the Baltic Sea, became part of the kingdom as a vassal of Sweden during the 11th and early 12th centuries. Under the leadership of §YKing Karl§!, who was crowned by §YEdgar the Ætheling of England§!, English clergy flooded into this traditional Norse kingdom. However, for Gotland, which flies its flag over the White Sea, the island has always been a deeply rooted Norse stronghold, rarely penetrated or influenced by Christianity.\n\nIn the following half-century, during the turbulent era later known as the §YNorthern Crusades§!, the Kingdom of Sweden sought to spread the glory of God and the king across the Scandinavian Peninsula. Captives and refugees of the traditional faith continuously poured in. The kingdom's grip and legal control over this sea grew increasingly lax and ineffective. In the chaotic centuries that followed, §YErik the Griffin§!, a Danish rebel general from the Wendish coast, led his fleet and rallied pirates from across the Baltic. With the help of traditional Norse allies within Visby, he captured Gotland and declared himself Admiral of the Fleet. Mercenaries, outlaws, refugees, and adventurers from all over Scandinavia flocked to this free city. In this era of chaos, Gotland became the new master of the White Sea, renowned across the seas as the Black Flag Alliance, striking fear into the hearts of merchants from all nations.\n\nHowever, as the fires of war gradually died down and order was slowly restored, the Nordic kingdoms began to solidify their footing, and Gotland's regime appeared increasingly precarious. Rulers of various nations yearned to obliterate this den of detestable outlaws that threatened their coasts, bringing Gotland under their royal authority. The Pirate League's forces were forced to retreat from the entire northern seas to the vicinity of Gotland Island. Surrounded by enemies, will the captains of Visby face the end of their era, or will they lead the Black Flag Alliance to even greater seas? It is time for the entire North, for all sailors upon the ocean, to understand who truly is the §YUncrowned King§! of the Seven Seas. The free harbor will shelter the brave who fear no storm."
