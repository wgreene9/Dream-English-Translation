DD_GAL_1_t: "The Vast Sea"
DD_GAL_1_d: "Prince Sancho, the Navigator of Galicia, swore that in his lifetime of adventures, he had never encountered such beautiful islands. These islands appeared in the middle of his journey across the vast ocean, where he had not seen land for almost a week. These beautiful islands, like petals scattered by angels on the mortal world, appeared pristine and untouched.\n\nAfter the navigator reported the news to him, he could hardly contain his excitement, and the sailors had already brought out the kingdom's flag. As Sancho gazed at the land growing closer to the fleet, he couldn't help but smile. It seemed now that the vast ocean was indeed welcoming his adventure and conquest."
DD_GAL_1a: "From now on, this land belongs to the Kingdom of [Root.GetName]!"
