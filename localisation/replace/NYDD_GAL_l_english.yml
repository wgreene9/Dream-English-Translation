DD_GAL_1_t: "The Vast Sea"
DD_GAL_1_d: "Prince Sancho, the Navigator of Galicia, swore that in his lifetime of adventures, he had never encountered such beautiful islands. These islands appeared in the middle of his journey across the vast ocean, where he had not seen land for almost a week. These beautiful islands, like petals scattered by angels on the mortal world, appeared pristine and untouched.\n\nAfter the navigator reported the news to him, he could hardly contain his excitement, and the sailors had already brought out the kingdom's flag. As Sancho gazed at the land growing closer to the fleet, he couldn't help but smile. It seemed now that the vast ocean was indeed welcoming his adventure and conquest."
DD_GAL_1a: "From now on, this land belongs to the Kingdom of [Root.GetName]!"
 DD_GAL_2_t: "Ambitions Soaring High"
 DD_GAL_2_d: "In the newly established temporary base at the Azores, Sancho is planning his next voyage. In his grand vision, the ocean depths must conceal more alluring treasures and riches - those mythical places from legends might be real! Those mysterious rumors and fog-shrouded tales seem to gradually unveil before his eyes, waiting for him to lift their veils. Yet his advisors are deeply concerned. Discovering the Azores might have been one blessed voyage, but continuing westward would be pure folly. At the edge of the endless blue, beneath that monotonous horizon, might lie the terrifying end of the world. Even if land exists beyond, how far could they possibly go into the completely unknown?"
 DD_GAL_2a: "Sancho remains obstinate."
 DD_GAL_2b: "Sancho heeds counsel."
 DD_GAL_2a_tt: "Sancho turns away resolutely, as if having made up his mind.\n"
 DD_GAL_2b_tt: "§RThis path is not yet implemented~§!\n"
 DD_GAL_3_t: "Make Full Use of Resources"
 DD_GAL_3_d: "Since we intend to depart, we'd best take everything we can carry - this voyage might be one from which there's no return. A completely new, unknown, and dangerous world awaits our exploration, and we must be mentally prepared accordingly."
 DD_GAL_3a: "Leave an outpost behind."
 DD_GAL_3b: "Take everything portable."
 DD_GAL_3a_modifier: "Abandoned Colony"
 DD_GAL_3a_tt: "Leave an outpost at §Y[367.GetName]§! - just in case we might return someday?\n\nUpon reaching the next destination, our supplies will be §Rreduced§!.\n"
 DD_GAL_3b_tt: "The §Rrisks of this journey are unknown§! - we must give it our all.\n\nAfter reaching the next destination, the colony at §Y[367.GetName]§! will be §Rdestroyed§!.\n"
 desc_DD_GAL_3a_modifier: "This province still has some abandoned living facilities... could someone have been here before?"
 DD_GAL_4_t: "Setting Sail"
 DD_GAL_4_d: "As the last sliver of land disappears below the horizon, deathly silence falls over the ship's cabins. The joy of departure is swallowed by the vast ocean, leaving only mortal unease behind."
 DD_GAL_4a: "Will we ever return?"
 DD_GAL_5_t: "The Storm"
 DD_GAL_5_d: "The day began as perfect sailing weather, but the temperamental sea summoned a storm, unleashing her fury without restraint. In an instant, howling winds scattered the fleet, leaving ships disoriented. Yet miraculously, a few vessels survived the terrifying tempest, with shaken crews and their ships washing ashore on a mysterious land."
 DD_GAL_5a: "I must regroup my forces."
 DD_GAL_5a_modifier: "Tempered Through Hardship"

 DD_GAL_6_t: "New Homeland"
 DD_GAL_6_d: "Soon, other scattered fleet members gathered around the beacon fire from Sancho's flagship. In makeshift shelters, the accompanying priest conducted the first Mass in this New World. A series of temporary facilities were erected to defend against potential attacks, mostly built from planks of the wrecked ships that would never sail again. Although food and fresh water remained challenging trials, the survivors who had narrowly escaped death seemed to have no energy left to dwell on these problems."
 DD_GAL_6a: "We might be the first Europeans to see this New World."
 DD_GAL_6a_tt: "With the establishment of the new settlement, the Old World has been left behind.\nYet unrest and anxiety quickly descended upon the camp.\n\n"
 DD_GAL_6a_tt1: "Fortunately, we brought everything we could carry, which will aid our settlement's development.\n- §Y[486.GetName]§! gains an additional §G3§! development\n- Slightly §Galleviates§! the '§YAfter the Cataclysm§!' modifier"
 DD_GAL_crash_modifier1: "After the Cataclysm"
 DD_GAL_crash_modifier2: "After the Cataclysm"
 desc_DD_GAL_crash_modifier1: "We're all struggling desperately to survive."
 desc_DD_GAL_crash_modifier2: "We're all struggling desperately to survive."
 DD_GAL_7_t: "No Peace in Sight"
 DD_GAL_7_d: "We've been deceived! The people suddenly realized - what use was discovering the New World when completely cut off from the Old? They might be the New World's first pioneers, but would also become its first martyrs. Isolated here without communication, lacking supplies and enduring hardships, God's gospel and grace seemed completely absent from this savage, primitive land, as if they'd been abandoned by the world. Fueled by betrayal's fury and terror of permanent separation from their homeland, the angry expedition members surrounded Sancho's tent, demanding answers."
 DD_GAL_7a: "But it's already too late..."

 DD_GAL_8_t: "The Last Hope"
 DD_GAL_8_d: "When all hope seemed lost, a glimmer of salvation appeared. After inspection, people were astonished to find that Sancho's flagship, the 'Esperanza', was still seaworthy - though... she looked battered and broken, this poor old lady having endured too much of the storm's fury, appearing barely capable of another voyage. Yet now, she was our one and final hope."
 DD_GAL_8a: "Carry our hopes and sail into the distance..."
 DD_GAL_8b: "There's no turning back - we must rely on ourselves now..."
 DD_GAL_8a_tt: ""
 DD_GAL_8b_tt: ""
 DD_GAL_9_t: "Starting From Scratch"
 DD_GAL_9_d: "The despairing survivors sat in a circle, silently awaiting death's arrival in mute hopelessness, not even noticing when they became surrounded by mysterious figures. The enthusiastic natives chattered in incomprehensible tongues, bringing the most coveted gifts - food and seeds. As these seeds of survival took root, they offered at least a temporary reprieve from certain demise."
 DD_GAL_9a: "A new day, perhaps?"

NEW_GAL: "New Galicia"
NEW_GAL_ADJ: "New Galician"
DD_GAL_9a_modifier: "Food Shortages"
desc_DD_GAL_9a_modifier: "The seeds have just been sown, and we can only survive through occasional aid from the natives. Perhaps we should establish a festival to thank them?"
DD_GAL_10_t: "Miracle Reborn"
DD_GAL_10_d: "The gaunt and starving survivors sat in circles, drawing lots to determine the next 'lucky one' - for release from suffering. The campfire flickered weakly. In just a few months, this settlement had nearly regressed to primitive society. The cruel north wind extinguished their feeble fire, and with it, their last will to survive. Some began screaming, cursing how this was all a mistake - until a ship's pointed mast broke through the hazy horizon, then two, then three... The Esperanza had succeeded! Their brethren from distant Spain brought supplies, hope, and a royal decree from their homeland's court."
DD_GAL_10a: "\"We appoint [Root.Monarch.GetName] as Governor of Hispaniola.\""
ISPAIN_ISLAND: "Hispaniola"
ISPAIN_ISLAND_ADJ: "Hispaniolan"

DD_GAL_10a_modifier: "Settlement Party"
DD_GAL_11_t: "Unknown Frontiers"
DD_GAL_11_d: "At dawn's first light, Sancho was awakened by commotion outside. In the port of [Root.Capital.GetName], an enormous warship had appeared inexplicably - like Noah's divinely-commissioned Ark, more magnificent than any vessel Sancho had ever seen. None knew how or why it came to be there. Stranger still, its bridge contained nautical charts leading to unknown western realms.\n\nWithout hesitation, Sancho declared this his secretly-constructed new flagship, christening it 'Esperanza' for an unprecedented voyage to break their dire predicament. In truth, even he remained mystified."
