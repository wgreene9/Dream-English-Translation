DD_ENG_1_t: "Path to Atonement"
DD_ENG_1_d: "The wild storms are the wrath of God, and the long imprisonment is the penance of sinners. The French conquest shattered our illusion of prosperity, and the Norse invasions brought us a warning from the Lord. Terrible disasters could not break us; the people of England lay dormant in the ruins of our homeland, repenting for our past indulgence, waiting for the day to reclaim our freedom. Finally, a glimmer of hope has appeared on the long path of atonement. Amidst the chaos in France, we seized the opportunity for independence. After another French invasion ended in failure, we used the trade we seized from the Hanseatic League to build our proud navy, to prevent any future French invasions.\n\nMeanwhile, our nearby allies in the Low Countries continuously provided us with abundant resources and trade. The recent turmoil in the North Sea Empire is now widely known, and perhaps soon the situation in England will change dramatically. A monumental transformation awaits us. The hope of reclaiming our homeland no longer seems like a distant dream. Our secret aid has been swiftly sent to the Danelaw to support local resistance forces. If the winds of change blow, we hope they will prove useful. The sins of the past brought calamity, and years of patience have been spent plotting our restoration."
DD_ENG_1a: "Our journey of atonement is finally nearing its end."

DD_ENG_2_t: "The Reunification of England"
DD_ENG_2_d: "'Through suffering, great achievements are made.'\n\nThe Norse invaders from the north swept across the British Isles like a massive tsunami, bringing countless disasters and chaos to the English. Meanwhile, the French from the south seized the lands of the former Kingdom of Wessex, leaving only a few cities in the east struggling to maintain their independence.\n\nBut no ocean is unconquerable, and no storm is insurmountable. Even the roughest seas will one day be conquered by fearless sailors. The dark clouds over Britain will eventually disperse, and the dawn of freedom will once again shine over the land of England. The collapse of the North Sea Empire has proven this; their centuries of sins will be washed away by the turbulent times. The French, too, face the glorious judgment of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nThe millions of people in England have never succumbed to the 'poison' of time. Since the fall, countless visionaries have raised the banner of freedom. Now, we are finally reborn. From Northumbria to Wessex, the traces of the Norse and the French have vanished. We, the rightful rulers of the evergreen land of Britain, can once again proudly declare that England is united! Our centuries of resistance and ultimate victory serve as a warning to any who dare to covet England: 'You may conquer England, bind her, tear her apart, burn her to ashes, and scatter her remains into the sea…'"
DD_ENG_2a: "'…but she will be reborn, she will rise, and she will liberate all.'"

DD_ENG_3_t: "The End of the Danelaw"
DD_ENG_3_d: "'Trapped in time, trapped in ourselves.'\n\nWe were once the bravest Norse warriors, sons of Odin. We traveled far and wide to conquer the lands of England. For centuries, we fought against endless rebellions; we were the conquerors of this unruly land. Yet all of this came to an end with the silence of the North Sea Empire. In the fog of England's confusion, a lost generation in the Danelaw struggled to find a way forward.\n\n'End the hatred, stop the hostility!' some cried. Standing alone in a foreign land, we, like the homeless English, are part of the Danelaw. After radicals were purged, rebels crushed, and dissenters pacified, we declared equal status for the English. They could participate more broadly in public affairs without fear of Norse oversight or discrimination. Although some old Norse loyalists claimed we were betraying our ancestors, for the Danelaw, this was a necessary step.\n\nFrom now on, we are no longer mortal enemies, not enslaved, not oppressed…"
DD_ENG_3a: "…for we are one people of one nation, indivisible and inseparable."

DD_ENG_4_t: "The Rebirth of the Danelaw"
DD_ENG_4_d: "'Trapped in time, trapped in ourselves.'\n\nWe were once the bravest Norse warriors, sons of Odin. We traveled far and wide to conquer the lands of England. For centuries, we fought against endless rebellions; we were the conquerors of this unruly land. Yet all of this came to an end with the silence of the North Sea Empire. In the fog of England's confusion, a lost generation in the Danelaw struggled to find a way forward.\n\n'Refuse to yield, crush the traitors!' some cried. Standing alone in a foreign land, we are not like the homeless English; we are the rulers, the conquerors, and they are the ungrateful weaklings! To solidify our rule, we have tried compromise and reconciliation, but they have repeatedly shaken our foundations, opposed our rule, and crossed our boundaries. The past is gone. We will restore ancient punishments, recruit collaborators, and deter those who dare to raise the banner of rebellion. Although some may think this is too extreme, it is a necessary measure in these critical times."
DD_ENG_4a: "In these difficult times, we have only the Lord and ourselves to rely on."
