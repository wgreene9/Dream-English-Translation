 DD_colony_1_t: "Colonial Expansion"
 DD_colony_1_d: "The unknown lands across the ocean are a new world full of opportunities and challenges, attracting countless adventurers seeking to change their lives. With royal funding, our first colonial settlement has been established, marking the first step in our exploration of the new world and the first footnote in the history of a great empire. Our colony will continue to grow and develop as a directly governed territory under royal patronage until one day it becomes the cornerstone of our colonial empire."
 DD_colony_1a: "The New World Awaits!"
 DD_colony_1a_tt: "Before embracing §YColonialism§!, §Y[Root.GetName]§! cannot establish §MColonial Nations§!.\n\nFurthermore, §Yoverseas§! provinces in §Ycolonial regions§! will gain '§YColonial Self-Rule§!' with the following effects:\n[local_governing_cost]: §G-25.0%§!\n[min_local_autonomy]: §R+50.0§!\n\n"

 desc_DD_colony_1a_modifier: "This province remains in early colonial development, primarily governed by local settlers."
 DD_colony_2_t: "Colonial Standardization"
 DD_colony_2_d: "With the rise of colonial fervor and the wave of exploration in the new world, our colonies have grown significantly. It is time to establish specialized colonial institutions and local government organizations to standardize colonial administration. We can attract adventurers, private merchants, and speculators to form trading companies to manage the colonies, or formally appoint governors to oversee them, bringing the colonies under direct government control."
 DD_colony_2a: "Continue Direct Control."
 DD_colony_2a_tt: "§YWe shall maintain direct control of our colonies.§!\n§gWe can still establish Colonial Nations at any time by clicking the button in the upper right corner of the corresponding colonial province.§!\n\nThe modifier '§YColonial Self-Rule§!' will now only apply for the initial §Y10§! years, after which it will be replaced by '§YColonial Standardization§!' with these effects:\n[local_governing_cost]: §G-10.0%§!\n[min_local_autonomy]: §R+25.0§!\n"
 DD_colony_2a_modifier: "Colonial Standardization"
 desc_DD_colony_2a_modifier: "This province has been integrated into the mother country's administrative system, though distance still allows considerable self-governance."
 DD_colony_2b: "Establish Governorates."
 DD_colony_2b_tt: "§Y[Root.GetName]§! will immediately establish a §YColonial Nation§! in its colonies.\n§gRequires owning §Y5§! cored provinces.§!\n"

 DD_colony_10_t: "Land of the Gospel"
 DD_colony_10_d: "With the opening of new sea routes, the vast new world gradually came into the view of Europeans. Devout monks were astonished to discover that there was still such an uncivilized land untouched by the Gospel of God. A group of Franciscan and Dominican missionaries approached the Pope, requesting permission and support to spread the faith in the new world. They aimed to establish a missionary base, bringing civilization, faith, redemption, and a better life to the unenlightened new world."
 DD_colony_10a: "By the Grace of God."
# Terra Evangelii, launched by the Papal State, requires the New World to be discovered and during the Age of Reformation. Composed of Franciscan missionaries, it aims to spread the Gospel to the New World, meaning "Land of the Gospel."

 DD_colony_11_t: "Mississippi Pioneers"
 DD_colony_11_d: "The discovery of the New World and the legends of the golden land spread across Europe with the Atlantic winds, igniting a wave of colonial fervor. A wealthy merchant from Rouen, Robert de La Salle, claimed to have returned from America, discovering a promising land and a vast river. He believed this river could lead to the fabled land of gold, China. Robert requested the king's support for his venture, promising to bring wealth and resources from this land while ultimately pledging loyalty to the great King of France."
 DD_colony_11a: "Bring wealth back to France."
 DD_colony_11b: "This sounds too vague."

 DD_colony_12_t: "The Free Land of the New Century"
 DD_colony_12_d: "For nobles, war is a ladder to glory and achievement, but for ordinary people, war is simply hell. The chaos and endless wars in England left thousands of civilians displaced, and Francis Drake was one of them. War destroyed his livelihood, and unwilling to be conscripted to die on the battlefield, his only option was to take to the seas.\n\nAfter years as a sailor under a captain, Francis became an immigrant captain for the Virginia Company. After several failed colonial attempts, the company nearly abandoned the route. However, Francis, hearing tales of wealth and opportunity in the New World, refused to let the chance slip away. He fled the company with a few ships filled with desperate refugees and successfully reached the New World. Now, before them lies a land of freedom and peace, a new world waiting to be explored."
 DD_colony_12a: "A peaceful and happy free state..."

 DD_colony_13_t: "Overburdened"
 DD_colony_13_d: "The land of the Andalusians is a place of constant strife and disaster. Beyond the never-ending Reconquista and the looming threat of the Crusaders, conflicts between local lords never cease. After news of the new sea routes spread, a group of adventurers seeking wealth and farmers tired of chaos and heavy taxes, led by a man named 'Aben Humeya,' decided to set out for the New World in search of a fertile and peaceful land."
 DD_colony_13a: "Another contender for the New World."
# New Granada

 DD_colony_14_t: "Conqueror of Mexico"
 DD_colony_14_d: "Hernán Cortés, born as the second son of a noble family, had no claim to titles or land. But Hernán was a man who refused mediocrity. He participated in the colonization of Cuba and eventually became the treasurer and mayor of Santiago, yet he was not satisfied. Hernán heard of cities in Mexico filled with immense wealth, gold, and jewels. Acting on his own, he assembled an expedition and miraculously invaded the Aztec kingdom. Now, they seek our support to establish a larger, long-term colonial government, aiming to bring all of Mexico under control."
 DD_colony_14a: "We will fully support this."
 DD_colony_14b: "Unfortunately, we cannot afford it."
 
# Veracruz
 DD_colony_15_t: "The Golden Expedition"
 DD_colony_15_d: "The success of the Mexican conqueror Cortés undoubtedly inspired a large group of adventurers eager for wealth and fame, and Francisco Pizarro was one of them. Ambitious Pizarro, drawn by the legend of the Inca's golden kingdom, organized a hundred-man expedition to invade the Inca. Although his initial invasions only yielded partial gold, they proved that the tales of the land's riches were not false and showcased his remarkable talent. Pizarro's bold plan gained support from many adventurers and speculators, and now he requests our funding to conquer this coveted golden kingdom for our empire."
