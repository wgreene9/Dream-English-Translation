DD_WUU_1_t: "The Sky Obscured by Crimson Flames"
DD_WUU_1_d: "Ji Yanxin, son of the Grand Marshal, was widely known for his benevolence and gentle demeanor. Few officials doubted his virtuous character. Yet, in truth, this man was sinister and adept at feigning virtue, having deceived everyone for over twenty years with his masterful performance.\n\nAs he had proven reliable since childhood, Ji Chuyuan entrusted his son with numerous administrative duties, granting him significant authority. The trusting father never suspected his son. Little did Ji Chuyuan know that once Ji Yanxin had secured his power, his first act was to secretly raise a private militia, drilling them in a secluded estate in the Western Hills. This treacherous son, his ambition ignited after his father became a powerful minister, believed he could seize the throne for himself—even coveting the Dragon Throne itself. After meticulous planning, he resolved to forge his path to power with fire, using his father's charred corpse as stepping stones.\n\nSoon, the opportunity arose. On a day when Ji Chuyuan was to personally inspect the Western Hills Villa—where military equipment for the Central Army was stored, requiring quarterly inspections—Ji Yanxin saw his chance. Previously, these inspections had been delegated to Ji Yanxin, but this time, he persuaded his father that a personal appearance would bolster his authority. Ji Chuyuan agreed, assuming it a mere formality. Hadn't his capable son always managed everything flawlessly?\n\nBut Ji Yanxin had laid his trap. After Ji Chuyuan entered the courtyard, Ji Yanxin excused himself to guard the gate, then secretly had it barred and blocked. Unaware, Ji Chuyuan and his trusted aides entered the storeroom, admiring the neatly arranged weapons and praising his 'exceptional son.'\n\nOnly when the air grew thick with heat and smoke did panic set in. An aide, horrified, spotted flames outside the windows. Ji Chuyuan rushed out to find the courtyard—once ignored piles of hay and straw—now an inferno, the gate already engulfed. An aide desperately kicked at the immovable gate. In desperation, others formed a human ladder, hoping to lift Ji Chuyuan over the wall. But as the top aide reached up, arrows struck him down—one through the forehead—shattering all hope. Outside, Ji Yanxin's private guards stood watch, not only preventing escape but hurling torches and combustibles to feed the blaze.\n\nDonning a helmet, Ji Chuyuan cautiously climbed a watchtower. There, through the flames, he saw his beloved son—the very man he had just praised—standing calmly amid the soldiers. The revelation struck him like a thunderbolt. Moments later, comprehension dawned, and he beat his chest in anguish, weeping, 'Now I see this wolf-hearted son seeks to devour his father!'\n\nThe fire raged for three days and nights, its flames and smoke blotting out the sky. Beams and pillars collapsed, reducing the Western Hills Villa to ashes. Returning to court, Ji Yanxin wept profusely, claiming a accidental fire—a 'divine conflagration'—had destroyed the stores and his father's body beyond recognition. Professing despair, he begged to retire. The Emperor Xu, consoling him, bestowed upon him all of Ji Chuyuan's former titles."
DD_WUU_1a: "How dare we dwell in grief? We must uphold the legacy and carry on."
DD_WUU_2_t: "Humble Before the Usurpation"
DD_WUU_2_d: "After orchestrating his father's death by fire, Ji Yanxin maintained the facade of a loyal minister for but a few days. He soon realized that seizing power had always been straightforward—it was only his father's reluctance to cross the final threshold that had held them back. He began consolidating his father's network, and through shrewd maneuvering, even had Wu Yunpei—who had been imprisoned by Ji Chuyuan for repeatedly urging the Emperor to abdicate—released and reinstated under the guise of benevolent governance. By the time the Emperor belatedly recognized that the new power-holder's control was far more constricting than his predecessor's, it was too late. Under the collective pressure of his officials, the last Emperor of Great Xu had no choice but to announce his abdication in favor of the virtuous."

DD_WUU_3_t: "The Royal Banner Shifts on the Battlements"
DD_WUU_3_d: "Startling news arrived in quick succession: first, the renowned Grand Marshal and Prince of Wu, Ji Chuyuan, had met a sudden end in a fire; then, word came that his son, Ji Yanxin, had accepted the abdication of the throne. Abdication? More likely usurpation. Although [Root.GetName] had never seen eye-to-eye with the imperial court, this was undoubtedly a heaven-sent opportunity. Ji Chuyuan's unexpected death meant the fragile surface order he had barely maintained was bound to shatter like a water droplet losing its surface tension. Now, his son's usurpation gave almost everyone a legitimate cause for war.\n\nPerhaps this was not entirely bad news."
