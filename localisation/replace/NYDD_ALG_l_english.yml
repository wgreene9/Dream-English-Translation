Our brothers march to battle! Why linger here? What do you seek? What gain? Is life so dear, peace so sweet, purchased with chains and slavery? Almighty God, stay them! Others may choose differently, but for me:  §RGive me liberty, or give me death!§!"
 NYDD_ALG_attrat_pirate_title: "Approaching Pirates"

 NYDD_ALG_iberia_desc: "Iberia's called scales where Christians and Muslims clash. Now scales tip, blood flows through rivers, peace vanished. Past guides future. Since balanced scales once brought Iberian peace, we must rebuild and reinforce them."
