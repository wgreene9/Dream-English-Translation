 DD_ALG_1_t: "The Oathbreaker"
 DD_ALG_1_d: "So it has come to pass as foretold. [Root.Monarch.GetName] once naively believed that betraying their own people was the only bloody path to save the nation - or at least to save as many as possible. But the Franks' bloodthirst and brutality are plain for all to see. Village after village connected to the rebels has been wiped out. And these shall become blood debts piled upon the Zayyanid dynasty.\n\nThe world is like a grand theater forged by the wheel of fate, and those tragic, absurd farces seem to be playing out once again. Another uprising, another war, another despair, another betrayal - just as we betrayed our kin like casting off limbs, the Franks have discarded us like worn-out shoes. The furious rebels from the desert sands approach with single-minded vengeance in their hearts. How will [Root.Monarch.GetName] and their dynasty survive?"

 DD_ALG_2_d: "Recently, a major event occurred in the royal city of Tunis. Some upstart claiming to be the 'Mad King's' bastard has united nobles and clergy to seize control of the kingdom. Now rumors fill every street that this new ruler Rodrigo is Africa's savior, possessing knightly virtues and the nobility of El Cid. Perhaps... just perhaps... we might find a slim chance of survival as we did in the past..."

Messenger after messenger has been sent to Tlemcen hoping to speak with that old man locals call 'The Prisoner,' but all have vanished without trace. [Root.Monarch.GetName] rubs their temples in despair. Is there truly no way out? They thought all shared the same blood as brethren. Perhaps, however slim the hope, someone - even just one person - might understand them. At least all share one feeling - to save their people and preserve Islam."
 DD_ALG_4a: "Don't lose heart. Send another messenger."

 DD_ALG_6a: "Relax. It's just death. The ancestors of this land have done it before. You'll do just fine."
 DD_ALG_7_t: "The Blood Oath"
 DD_ALG_7_d: "Your hands tremble. The justifications that once convinced you now ring hollow - or perhaps they've long fallen silent beneath the countless roars in your heart, especially with an African envoy standing beside you. No, you must do this. You must prove your 'worth', your loyalty to Africa. Lives, blood, nation and soul - you've sacrificed so much already. You cannot let it all go to waste now. For a moment, you can't tell whether you're the executioner or the bearded man before you is. His eyes brim with mockery, scorn, and... a hint of pity. You see his cracked lips silently scream: 'Do it.'"

 DD_ALG_8_t: "Letter of Atonement"
 DD_ALG_8_d: "To Our Brethren,\n\nA century has passed since the Franks first brought their blades to our shores. A century of bloodshed, of souls lost, where joy and glory alike turned to dust. Our ancient homeland lies in ruins, its people suffering. We made paradise a wasteland, turned our years into flowing water. Our people perish in strife, eternally tormented in agony. I was born in the tide of Maghreb's resistance, witnessing with my own eyes how our brethren's blood formed rivers that stained our land to cinders. Chaos, atrocities, sin - nothing has changed.\n\nIf the storm cannot be resisted, then at least let our homes be preserved beneath the calamity - whether the cost be eternal scorn in life or everlasting flames consuming my soul after death. I never expected the children of Maghreb to forgive my sins, only that the Almighty Lord of Heaven might judge my soul fairly. History will place all I've done upon eternal scales - my soul may prove light as a feather, or heavy as a thousand weights.\n\nNow my brethren raise crimson tides before my eyes again. I know not what this will bring our land - true freedom, or vermilion disaster? Regardless, the sins upon my back are already too heavy - far beyond what blood can repay. My ideals stand upon countless corpses; let them now sink forever into the deep sea. My family and I shall forever renounce the governorship--"
 DD_ALG_8a: "May the Almighty and Infallible Supreme Lord bless your cause."

 DD_ALG_9_t: "Plenipotentiary"
 DD_ALG_9_d: "Only those who share the same blood truly understand and know your enemies. Only as 'brethren' can we Berbers properly rule the kingdom's most rebellious foreign subjects. We rule, we submit, we survive - if dying nations in these desert sands must be shackled, at least let us be the ones to fasten their chains. Souls may be locked in dark prisons, but at least their bodies remain beneath free skies.\n\nTherefore, we request the Kingdom of Africa grant us full authority to administer all Moroccan and Maghrebi Berbers under the crown, expanding the Algiers Governorate's territorial rights. We shall become the kingdom's pillars, the beams supporting its towers. We will uphold a tyrannical kingdom, and for our people... preserve a pure land of peace and prosperity."
 DD_ALG_9a: "Though mountains and rivers collapse, we seek but a corner to rest..."
 DD_ALG_9a_tt: "If @AFR§Y[AFR.GetName]§! §Gagrees§!, all §YMaghreb§! provinces west of §YKabylia§! region except those of §YAfrican§! or §YMauritanian§! culture will come under §Y[From.GetName]§!'s control.\n\n§YThis will also grant us claims and casus belli westward.§!\n"

 DD_ALG_10_t: "Algiers' Proposal"
 DD_ALG_10_d: "Our Governor of Algiers brings an intriguing proposal, claiming they can solve the centuries-old problem plaguing our kingdom - to tame the Saracens of Maghreb as one would break wild beasts. Algiers requests we expand the governorate's territorial rights to administer Morocco and Maghreb's Berbers on the kingdom's behalf.\n\nAccepting would let us discard this burning coal that has brought Africa endless disasters and drained the kingdom. So long as Algiers remains loyal, we can extract more from Maghreb without stability costs and rule more securely."
 DD_ALG_10a: "Accept the governor's proposal."
 DD_ALG_10b: "No, we'll handle this ourselves."

 ALG_CANT_WAR_OTHER: "§RUnfortunately, we are only permitted to declare war on nations within designated regions.§!"

 DD_ALG_11_t: "Our Land, Our Blood"
 DD_ALG_11_d: "The earth bleeds.\n\nWar isn't the only scourge - greed and ambition bring equal ruin. The peace we bought with our souls merely delivers this land to another gallows. They fashion their exploitation into nooses around our necks. Before our eyes, our homeland is slowly strangled - blood and wails forced from its throat while we stand powerless.\n\nPowerless! Why? Why must souls sacrificed and lives given still yield only hell? The peaceful land we dreamed of, the prosperity we craved, the tranquil corner we sought at all costs - why must they vanish like mirages? Blood, blood - crimson horror veils our dreams.\n\nO soul... soul. How many more worthless souls must we sell to sustain these ideals built upon corpses? Our land flows with our own blood, like a dying man thrashing at the noose. Are broken-winged birds doomed to never again see clear skies? Are suffering peoples born to be slaves of fate? How many sins... how many more sins must we commit to gain wings light enough for flight, yet strong enough to lift these impossibly heavy ideals?"

You mean the African king wants to send an envoy to Algiers to organize an elected governorship?'\n\nThe messenger remains cheerfully oblivious, as if delivering cruel edicts were nothing. 'Yes. Given recent unrest and expanded jurisdiction, King [AFR.Monarch.GetName] deems this necessary. The envoy will help Algiers elect its new governor. Of course, you currently face serious charges - treason, dereliction, etc. - so the next election likely won't concern you. Though Africa's treasury currently lacks funds for your trial.' Setting down the documents, the envoy offers the governor a faint smirk.\n\nBeads of sweat roll down [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s forehead. They'd imagined this day might come, but Africa's new king proves exceptionally quick to discard used tools. So be it. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has given their all for this land.

Below the precipice lay a dying kingdom, an ideal turned to mirage; above it, only a monarch without a country, a failed dreamer. Africa marches toward her twilight - the age of Crusaders has ended, one ideal vanquished by another.\n\nThe King spread his arms toward the distant clouds, as if to embrace the entire world. Once again, all means had been exhausted - foul and fair, base and honorable - yet nothing could halt this kingdom's pitiful collapse. Was he a good man? He knew not. If ideals had weight, surely theirs outweighed his by a single pound. With a faint smile, he stepped to the cliff's edge, then further still, falling into the soft bed of clouds."

He closed his eyes, praying tomorrow's work would be lighter, though he knew with each neighbor gone, the burden would only grow heavier for those remaining.
