DD_MOR_2_t: "The Cage"
DD_MOR_2_d: "How much time has passed? It's hard to tell, and I lack the ability to perceive it.\n\nThe cold prison, heavy shackles, whips, buckets, and torture. A man in iron armor presses a slave boy into the water, his feeble struggles only making his constricted lungs more painful. Before the despair of suffocation sets in, the boy's head is pulled out of the water. Unintelligible words, malicious and mocking laughter, and in an instant, it all turns into a terrifying hum and a dreadful silence. Cold water once again flows down his throat, squeezing his esophagus and stomach.\n\nAh, this must be the fire of hell, punishing those who do not respect the law, punishing souls that succumb to sin. But why? Oh, the one and only Allah, why am I in this endless demonic tomb—why does fate's cruelty refuse to spare the innocent traveler? The Prophet's empire is sliding into the abyss of destruction, where can the people of Allah go? The trembling body mourns for the broken homeland, the wailing soul lingers before the gates of evil and death.\n\n'Hold on, child.' In the damp corner of the prison, a dirty old man in a gray robe murmurs to himself. His aged and scarred body hides a mysterious soul in the shadows, his trembling voice like a mournful tune on a harp.\n\n'When the earth is overturned, when the sky collapses, Noah's ark will break through the walls of the flood, and the free birds will shatter the shackles of sin.'"
DD_MOR_2a: "Ship of dreams, ship of dreams, please carry us to the land of peace—"
DD_MOR_3_t: "Caged Bird"
DD_MOR_3_d: "In the desolate desert, a campfire burns in the cold night, its blazing light illuminating the determined faces wrapped in white robes around the camp. 'We have contacted Tarik's tribe; their elder is also imprisoned there.' Amid the crackling of the burning firewood, a man with a sword bows his head and speaks to the old man before him. The old man nods quietly, his gaunt face outlined by the cold light of the night, his hawk-like gaze fixed on the crescent moon in the dark sky.\n\nThe moonlight, like flowing ice, follows the fiery heart, bypassing the iron bars, and flows into the cold dreams of the prisoners. An old man wrapped in a thin cloth robe sits in a corner of the cell, while the young tribal heir still gazes blankly at the silver crescent outside the window. The stars and moon in the sky turn into sparkling starlight, reflecting in the caged bird's eyes like a galaxy; the indifferent night wind crosses the prison and the cage, gently brushing the dark hair on his forehead. Gazing, the caged bird still gazes, at the freedom beyond the iron bars that belongs to them and their homeland."

DD_MOR_4_d: "Headache, a splitting headache.\n\nHis entire body feels like it's soaked in boiling water, the unhealed wounds howling like demons, bringing indescribable pain and a sense of powerless despair. The young man, like thousands of his nameless compatriots in the lonely graves, lies on the dirty and cold floor of the cell, feeling his senses and consciousness gradually slipping away.\n\nForcing his blurred will, the man curls up and looks at the dying old man before him. In his dim eyes, there is an inexplicable light, something that the tattered and foul-smelling gray robe and the pus-filled wounds cannot hide. On the blood-stained floor, the old man's cracked lips move as if trying to say something—\n\nSuddenly, a loud noise breaks the deathly silence, followed by a heart-trembling hum. After emitting a teeth-grating mournful sound, the prison's outer wall collapses like sand, revealing the blazing firelight outside, bright as the scorching sun. The towering walls, cold iron bars, and gloomy fortress all seem to vanish like sand in the wind. The man's world turns upside down—in his clear eyes, he sees the free birds soaring high in the sky.\n\nThat is the bird he yearned for."

DD_MOR_5_t: "Instant Blaze"
DD_MOR_5_d: "The galloping horses create thunderous vibrations, the stirred-up dust dances wildly with the wind, suddenly raising a yellow curtain on the vast wilderness. The dense sound of iron hooves, the earth-shaking battle cries, are all swallowed by the devilish howls of the desert wind. In the dance of the wind, the campfires are extinguished one by one, and in the dark smoke, it's hard to see anything. The desert's god of death arrives in the chaos.\n\nSuddenly, a flame ignites in the Crusaders' camp, rising into a towering blaze. A warrior in a white robe emerges from the chaotic sandstorm, the flickering flames outlining his young but determined face from the darkness. His sharp scimitar instantly breaks through the defenses of the soldier before him, the bright red blood staining his white robe. In his eyes, the red flames of anger burn for his homeland and his people."

DD_MOR_6_d: "The city walls collapse under the cannon fire, just like the sea washing away the sand. Plunder, slaughter, sin, just as they once did to us. The raging fire burns in the governor's city, like the chains of judgment from hell, turning the sins of this evil land and the pain of the past into ashes. Obsession becomes shackles, hatred turns into fire.\n\nTarik stands alone on the sand dune, silently watching the burning city. In the thick black smoke, cries and wails echo in the blazing fire, gradually swept into the hot sorrowful wind, turning into silence. Tarik just holds his pipe, standing on the cold sand dune. Warm smoke rings are exhaled from his abdomen, dissipating in the cold desert."

DD_MOR_7_d: "With both hands gripping the hilt of the sword stuck in his chest, Muhammad struggles to inhale the scorching air into his lungs. His body slowly, heavily falls to the ground, but he feels as if his soul is being pulled out of his body, helplessly watching everything happen. The crimson blood flows down the blade, as if still emitting warm steam, staining his carpet and robe, but he feels the cold desert's chill constantly invading his soul.\n\nHe sees his son, Musa, running towards him with a sword. The African assassin has already fallen dead outside the tent, and Muhammad can see Musa's anxious face, his open mouth and trembling hands, but his ears only hear the silence and hum of death. He struggles to lift his face, feeling the warm tears drop onto his waxen, gaunt face.\n\n'Don't make that face, child.' Muhammad places his cracked hand on his son's hand, letting the tears slide down his face, as if carving a tear trail."
DD_MOR_7a: "Life is about choices and having no choices, about how to deal with the inevitable."
DD_MOR_8_t: "Desert Meeting"
DD_MOR_8_d: "Tarik leans his tired body on the sofa, coldly watching the master and servant on the other side of the room through the hazy smoke from his pipe. A gloomy old vizier, a young sultan. Tarik slightly twitches the corner of his mouth, watching the new leader of Morocco cautiously sit in his seat, while the vizier respectfully stands behind.\n\n'I am sorry about your father.' Tarik holds his pipe, slowly spreading his hands towards the Sultan of Morocco. 'Undoubtedly, this is a shameful conspiracy by the Franks. The clouds of war are once again close at hand, no matter what conflicts or contradictions we have between us... or whatever, now is not the time.' Tarik looks at the young sultan silently staring at the floor, grinning as he declares: 'Our enemies are at the gates, shall we fight among ourselves, or raise our swords for Allah?'"
DD_MOR_8_d2: "Tarik leans his tired body on the sofa, coldly watching the empty seat on the other side of the room through the hazy smoke from his pipe. One after another, smoke rings gradually disappear into the night, until the sky turns pale. A gloomy old vizier, a young sultan, arrive in a hurry. Tarik slightly twitches the corner of his mouth, watching the failed rebel cautiously sit in his seat, while the vizier uneasily stands behind.\n\n'I am sorry about the uprising.' Tarik holds his pipe, slowly spreading his hands towards the Sultan of Morocco. 'Undoubtedly, this is a last-ditch struggle by the Franks. The clouds of war are once again close at hand, no matter what conflicts or contradictions we have between us... or whatever, now is not the time.' Tarik looks at the young sultan silently staring at the floor, grinning as he declares: 'Our enemies are at the gates, and you have nowhere to go.'"
DD_MOR_8_d3: "Muhammad lifts the tent, but it is empty. After repeatedly confirming with the vizier, Muhammad has no choice but to sit down and wait. The old vizier gloomily stands, receiving the frontline report just delivered.\n\n'I am sorry. It seems Tarik won't be coming today.' The old vizier reads the brief report, slowly spreading his hands towards the Sultan of Morocco. 'Undoubtedly, he has already returned to Allah in the battle against the Franks.' The young sultan slightly twitches the corner of his mouth, sighing regretfully: 'It seems we can only return home.' The old vizier grins and says: 'Our enemies are at the gates, Your Majesty, now we can only rely on ourselves.'"

DD_MOR_9_t: "The Vizier's Rebellion"
DD_MOR_9_d: "Abu Zakariya Yahya, the vizier of the Wattasid family, is also a close relative of the Marinid family. When the old sultan was still alive, he was the right-hand man of the tribe and the sultan, the eagle of the dunes. His victories in the first Muslim uprising and several wars against the Franks in his youth earned him much support, and now, after the death of the old sultan, he continues to maintain the administrative machinery while constantly placing Wattasid family members into the government.\n\nNow, this treacherous jackal finally shows us his fangs. The vizier has declared himself the only sultan of Morocco, abolishing the Marinid family's rule. The second monarch of Morocco finally steps from behind the scenes to the front, claiming the position of the Islamic leader of the Maghreb. The Wattasid family's connections are like a huge spider web, enveloping all of Morocco."
DD_MOR_9a: "We will never yield to traitors!"
DD_MOR_10_t: "Savior in the Sea of Sand"
DD_MOR_10_d: "Musa stands on the cold night sand dune, looking at the blood-stained sand below the slope. Surrounding him are the sultan's guards on horseback. In the lonely moonlight, the cold light reflects off the iron armor on their chests. In the cold desert, Musa closes his eyes, feeling the cold wind brush past, lifting his robe.\n\nThe people crying in pain, the believers praying in the blood, the soldiers wailing in the ruins. Scenes flash by, appearing again and again, the suffering he has seen along the way, the sins he has known, a nation struggling in disaster, a land torn apart by sin and invasion. The howling wind in his ears seems to turn into the urgent pleas of men, women, and children, begging him to save this land.\n\nThe Maghreb has had two Mahdis. The knights of Iberia shattered the first Mahdi's dream of rebuilding the caliphate, and the descendants of the Franks shattered the second Mahdi's wish to reclaim our homeland. Musa is the third, the third Mahdi rising from the sea of sand. The traitors have been judged, the shackles have been shattered, the vision of the Maghreb and the Muslims will turn into the wild storm of the desert, and a true Mahdi will emerge from the sandstorm."

DD_MOR_11_d: "Although under the military threat of the Franks, we have temporarily put aside our differences with our compatriots and formed an alliance to fight against the infidels and seek a future for the followers of Allah, there is no doubt that conflicts and contradictions still widely exist among us and increase over time.\n\nAmong the Moroccans, their tribal alliance is not monolithic, many in power do not support our alliance, and are not satisfied with our pursuit of the leading position in the alliance. Many restless ambitious people are secretly stirring up opposition to the alliance, while others are using this to demand more benefits from us."

DD_MOR_12_d: "Fighting for interests, yielding to greed, being lured by the devils under the fire of hell, throwing the teachings of Allah and the Prophet behind, this is why we were defeated by the infidels and suffered so much. Unity brings victory, division leads to destruction. Lured by power and wealth, divided by jealousy and hatred, thus the Prophet's empire collapsed, and the people of Allah wandered. The invasion of the Franks represents the anger of Allah, we should regain our virtue of unity and create an equal nation for Islam.\n\nHablullah, in Arabic, means the rope of Allah, 'Hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not become divided,' which means Muslims should unite on the basis of common faith. We are brothers dedicated to the revival of the great cause of Islam, and various ethnic groups will, under the witness of Allah, rebuild the golden age with an equal union.\n\nOf course, such a structure is not as ideal as it sounds. Interests and conflicts are eternal themes, to control this wild horse, we must use bribes, division, or more unspeakable means to balance this galloping chariot and firmly hold its reins. Because the one who can represent Allah to lead this sacred alliance is, and only is, us."

Millions of broken and displaced families, wandering in the ruins, freezing to death in the cold night. In the disaster, sinking, in the oppression, struggling, the millions of souls of the Maghreb have finally reclaimed their land.\n\nOnce, we believed that compromise could win sympathy, cooperation could bring rewards. Time and time again, we endured, time and time again, we retreated, only to be met with humiliation and slaughter. Now, we will no longer tolerate invaders and infidels. We will no longer negotiate softly, we will no longer be at the mercy of others. The Maghreb will not yield to the fate imposed on us, our future will be decided by ourselves."

The giant rock named after Tariq ibn Ziyad stood at the gateway to the peninsula, like a giant guarding Iberia. Behind the conqueror's mountains, a beam of light broke through the clouds, passing over the towering stone pillars and scattering onto the azure sea. Behind the Mahdi, majestic ships emerged from the shadows of the clouds, the howling sea wind sweeping past the speeding fleet, the sails billowing with a fierce roar.\n\nAfter a century, the second Maghreb fleet finally crossed the Strait of Gibraltar once again. A truly sacred and noble Mahdi led the army of Allah, ready to save this chaotic land once more. Fanatical soldiers boarded the decks, and under the push of the raging sea wind, the continent awaiting salvation was now within sight. On the Mahdi's flagship, stirring music played along with the resounding trumpet, and then the entire sea echoed with urgent war music.

Leaderless Muslims were mercilessly slaughtered during the Frankish invasions. From Iberia to the Levant, from this shore to the other, the people of Allah had no place to call home.\n\nNow, once again, the suffering masses who refuse to endure hardship have reignited the flames of resistance. A new Mahdi has raised the banner of salvation for the cause of Islamic liberation once more. Once again, we stand on this scarred land. Unjust fate, sinful chains, and painful cycles—this corrupt world filled with evil deeds will be saved by us.

The old wounds of the battlefield of Tours have long healed under your rule, becoming a page in our glorious epic. Bards will sing of your victory amidst fire and sand, and your great deeds will become songs passed down through generations, accompanying your dynasty to eternity.\n\nO great sword of Allah, under your rule, the dream of the Caliphate is no longer a distant myth but a reality forged by your own hands.

In the labyrinth of books in the House of Wisdom, the last Caliph stood in front of a large floor-to-ceiling window. The fading afterglow passed through the intricate window patterns, like the claws of a demon resting on the book in the Caliph's hands, stinging his eyes. The Caliph hated seeing the sunset again.\n\nThat ugly, orange-yellow glow reminded him of the cold prison, of the glaring sunlight that pierced through the iron bars. He could not see the sky, nor the stars or the moon, only the harsh thin light that reminded him of his scars and humiliated heart. Limbs that felt like they were being eaten by worms, a trachea filled with filthy blood, and in those enslaved Muslims, a frantically beating heart, like a tormented soul, struggling to break free from its shackles.\n\nThe wild evening breeze brought the cold of the night, bringing the Caliph back from his memories. The invading wind recklessly flipped through the book in the Caliph's hands, and the flying pages danced wildly in the crimson twilight. The names of successive Caliphs, the disasters that plunged the Islamic world into the abyss time and time again, flashed before the Caliph's eyes, like a sun that refused to set.\n\nA soft sound. The Caliph slammed the book shut and followed the fading afterglow to look out at the land. The twilight of the approaching night was as decadent as a pool of blood, sinking far into the western mountains along with the era of disaster in the Islamic world.

The dim starlight flowed through the water-like moonlight into the gradually closing coffin, and in the intoxicating mist, Tariq only clenched his pipe tightly, staring intently at the narrow coffin.\n\nHandfuls of yellow earth were thrown onto the coffin, and a respected elder slowly sank to the bottom of the sea of sand. The gates of the world closed to him, and the halls of paradise opened to him. The elder who died in prison had given his life for the freedom of the sea of sand, and now, the elder's will still accompanied this turbulent voyage.

To escape the tyranny of the military government and forced conscription, many local Muslims had to flee, whether they were men, women, or children who had just learned to speak.\n\nThe liberated Muslims brought out much food, mostly citrus fruits, grapes, and melons secretly hidden in their homes, to reward our soldiers. The amount was so large that it piled up in the open space, forming colorful little hills. We promised to abolish all previous tyrannies, implement Islamic law justly and strictly, and give the locals the freedom they had long awaited.\n\nAlthough the markets in the city and the countryside still showed signs of depression due to the previous turmoil, the brutal military government had become history. Soon the entire city would become as prosperous as it was under the Umayyad Caliphate, with people living and working in peace and harmony."

After a brief period of glory, the empire established by our ancestors, like the Umayyad Empire, fell into division and decline, and Andalusia returned to the turbulent days of Taifa fragmentation.\n\nWe will not repeat the mistakes of our predecessors. We are about to achieve more than the Almoravid dynasty and even the Umayyad dynasty.

When we paraded this unfortunate man, wrapped in coarse cloth and attempting to disguise himself to escape the city, in a prisoner's cart through the streets, the crowd throwing stones and eggs almost blocked the wide avenue. The curses could be faintly heard even in neighboring cities.\n\nAfter a brief discussion, we decided to confiscate all the property of this last Emir and distribute it to the people, sentencing him to hanging to quell the chaos and unrest he brought to the Islamic world by falsely claiming the title of Caliph out of evil motives, giving all the eagerly awaiting Muslims a proper explanation.\n\nOn the day of the execution, [Root.Monarch.GetName] arrived at the scene and solemnly watched the entire process.

From her hollow eyes, you can only see your pale reflection, staring intently at yourself. Hot tears fall, sinking into the sea of sand, only stirring a few drops of dust before disappearing without a trace. Tears—bitter tears, an inexhaustible lake of tears, but even if this river of tragedy converges into a sea, it cannot shake the blood-stained blades of the Crusaders.

They shouted the title of traitor, adding many crimes to your name. Will someone cry for you? No need, you have done your best. Choice—choice! Since fate demands you stand on the other end of the scale, you should make the choice for this ugly sacrifice, as you have always done.\n\nA tender and warm little hand reaches into your palm, you remember her.

She opens her hand, a pure and unblemished flower blooms in your palm, you feel the fragrant scent of the flower spreading around you, the pure and untainted flower, rooted in your already blurred vision. One day, no need to make choices, no need to sit at the gambling table, all that is noble and ugly, joyful and painful, will return to the same path.

Survival. Survival! We must—sacrifice. Sin, whitewash, righteousness... you can no longer distinguish.\n\nNo, you are not guilty. The world is cruel and merciless, and you are just seeking a place for the lost souls—you just did what had to be done. Yes, you are innocent. The blood flowing from the ruins will seep into people's nightmares, the tears blown away by the yellow sand will fall into the land of sin. But these have nothing to do with you, right?\n\nYou took a deep breath, one after another smoke rings slowly exhaled from your mouth, hoping they could take something away.\n\nBut they just clung to your arms like devils, imprisoning your soul forever in this narrow cell, the sorrow and sin in your heart not alleviated one bit."

NYDD_MOR_sahara_route_desc: "The trans-Saharan trade route has always been a focal point of trade in the Maghreb region, but it came to a halt due to the Frankish invasions. Now, perhaps it is time to reconnect with the trade routes south of the Sahara Desert using caravans."
