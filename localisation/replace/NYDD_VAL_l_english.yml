DD_VAL_1_t: "Interregnum in Valencia"
DD_VAL_1_d: "The news of the previous king's death in battle has spread throughout the cities and villages of Valencia. Even farmers in remote areas are worried about the future of Valencia... The grief of losing a ruler has not yet been resolved, and now the Kingdom of Aragon to the north has made a clearly malicious demand. A prince of the Aragonese king claims the right to inherit Valencia and demands immediate access to the power he believes he deserves. The aggressive stance of the Aragonese has caused much discontent. Refusing this arrogant prince and paying tribute in exchange for the protection of the Kingdom of Aragon might be a wise choice, although it could also worsen our relations with them to some extent. In any case, the precarious situation of Valencia, leaderless and filled with anxiety, must be effectively resolved, or external enemies will seize the opportunity."
