DD_HRE_1_t: "France and the Empire"
DD_HRE_1_d: "Since the defeat of Southern France by the Emperor during the Albigensian Crusade and its incorporation into the Holy Roman Empire, it has maintained a high degree of autonomy. However, after the North-South War in Germany, the Emperor has increasingly neglected the management of France. The princes in this region now act on their own, fulfilling almost no obligations except for occasionally symbolically attending the Imperial Diet and sending a few hundred men in response to the Emperor's call. The bond between France and the Empire has become nominal, and the ancient oath has long since faded with time.\n\nTaking advantage of the Emperor's current weakness, the princes of France are eager to seize the opportunity to break away from the Empire and pursue the glory of the King of France. If the Emperor still harbors the intention of re-binding France to the Empire, it would be best to act quickly to restrain France; otherwise, it would be wise to decisively allow France to leave the Empire, preserving dignity for both sides."

DD_HRE_50_t: "The Second Great Schism"
DD_HRE_50_d: "Since the beginning of the Crusades, the cooperation between the Empire and the Papacy has been intimate. Every crusade has been backed by the full support of the Empire and the Papacy. The Empire protects Christendom while expanding its lands, and the Papacy endorses the Empire's rule, continuously extending the Church's authority and influence. People once thought that such an unstoppable era would continue indefinitely.\n\nWhen everything reaches its peak, contradictions accumulate. Although the Pope resides under the Empire's protection, he still maintains his supreme secular authority. The Emperor needs anointed coronation, the Holy See's recognition, divine rule, and unchallengeable power. The Pope uses this as leverage, obstructing the Emperor's power development within the Empire for years while expanding the Church's influence. In $YEAR$, the Emperor, unable to bear it any longer, issued the 'Sacramental Autonomy Act,' stipulating that the sacraments within the Holy Roman Empire would be arranged according to imperial law and the Diet. Not even Christ's vicar on earth could interfere. This move thoroughly enraged the Pope, as the Church's dissatisfaction with the Emperor had long been an open secret. He publicly summoned his supporters, announced the excommunication of the Emperor, and called for the election of an anti-Emperor. Although the Pope believed the Church's influence was as powerful as it had been centuries ago, the Church's era had long passed.\n\nThe humiliation of Canossa did not repeat itself. The current Emperor is not as flexible as Henry IV, but like Henry IV, he is vengeful. The Emperor convened the Diet, declaring the Pope to be licentious, corrupting the Church, blaspheming God, and coveting secular power, unworthy of being Christ's vicar. He installed an anti-Pope—the Archbishop of Cologne. German religious affairs should be managed by a German Pope.\n\nThe major powers of Europe have been watching for a long time, and this time, they do not mind adding fuel to the fire of the Holy Roman Empire—preferably burning it to ashes."
DD_HRE_50a: "I saw the Lamb open the seven seals..."
DD_HRE_51_t: "The Emperor's Triumph"
DD_HRE_51_d: "With the Emperor's complete victory in the religious wars, the Imperial Catholic Church has been confirmed as the only legitimate faith in the Holy Roman Empire. The corrupt Rome and its followers will be expelled. From now on, the Emperor-appointed Imperial Pope will oversee all religious affairs in the Empire, no longer accepting interference from any other forces. The Imperial Pope will only be loyal to God and the Empire.\n\nThe corruption and decadence of the old Roman Catholic Church will be swept away by us. A new, pure, and holy Imperial Catholic Church will implement Christ's will, leading the Empire and all faithful Christians. The sacred and only Catholic Church will reaffirm God's commandments and reform the corrupt Church."

DD_HRE_52_t: "The Holy See's Victory"
DD_HRE_52_d: "With the complete victory of the Holy See and the Holy League, the religious war that divided Christendom has finally come to an end. The Holy Roman Empire, this unholy empire, the evil stronghold, no longer deserves our support. The heavily sinful Emperor will be deposed and expelled from the Church and the Empire. The sacred doctrine of Rome has once again become the only legitimate faith in the Empire.\n\nThe evil Emperor can no longer use the name of faith to manipulate all of Europe and profit for himself. Sinners will suffer, and the wicked will be judged. From now on, the Roman Church will once again restore the authority and glory of Catholicism. Sin and corruption will be expelled, and those who usurp and blaspheme God will be judged."
DD_HRE_52a: "The Kingdom of Christ will descend upon us."
DD_HRE_53_t: "The Crossroads Under Heaven"
DD_HRE_53_d: "Since the German Sacramental Autonomy Act and the Pope's excommunication, the entire Christian world has been divided into two opposing camps since the beginning of the Holy Roman Empire. The Imperial Pope of Cologne and the Pope of Rome have excommunicated each other and issued interdicts, creating a deep chasm that splits Catholic Europe.\n\nNow, all Christians must make their own choice. The imposing Emperor stares intently at the princes, while the Roman clergy continuously distribute condemnations and polemical pamphlets. At the steps of Heaven, believers stand at the crossroads of faith, hesitating. Before them, one path leads to Heaven, the other to Hell. Or perhaps... both?"

The imposing Emperor stares intently at the princes, while the Roman clergy continuously distribute condemnations and polemical pamphlets. At the steps of Heaven, the faithful of the Empire stand at the crossroads of faith, hesitating.

DD_HRE_54b: "We will not betray the faith of Rome."
DD_HRE_55_t: "The Peace of Mainz"
DD_HRE_55_d: "Years of warfare have drained the Empire's blood and completely split Christendom and the Holy Roman Empire. The Imperial Catholic Church and the Holy League of Rome cannot determine a victor, and neither side is willing to yield. Ultimately, the Emperor had no choice but to acknowledge the power of the Imperial princes and part of the Roman Catholic Church's legitimate status, signing the treaty in Mainz.\n\nThis war has thoroughly brought the once mighty Empire to its grave. Although the war has ended, supporters of the two Churches still quarrel everywhere. According to the Peace of Mainz, the Empire's faith is determined by its monarch, and each principality has religious freedom. The chaotic yet tolerant religious situation has allowed other ideas to flourish, and many who are disillusioned with the Church have made their own choices."
DD_HRE_55a: "'He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death…'"

DD_HRE_56_t: "The Imperial Catholic Church"
DD_HRE_56_d: "Now that we have established the Imperial Catholic Church, it is time to lobby the members of the Empire to break free from the folly of the Roman Papacy and join the Church under our control."
DD_HRE_56a: "Establish the Holy See in [Root.Capital.GetName]."
DD_HRE_56b: "Establish the Holy See in Cologne."

DD_HRE_57_t: "The Imperial Diet"
DD_HRE_57_d: "It seems the Pope of Rome does not have the courage to challenge the Imperial Pope and the Holy Roman Emperor, as all he has done these days is send his mediocre and cowardly clergy to distribute meaningless and laughable condemnations throughout the Empire... Those princes who sought to rebel against the Emperor under the Pope's authority have seen the reality: the religious leader they rely on is nothing but an arrogant, incompetent, and weak-willed man who has neither the strength nor the courage to wage a so-called 'religious war' against the Emperor, who has God's approval.\n\nEmperor [emperor.Monarch.GetName] has sent envoys to the Pope of Rome to deliver the Empire's ultimatum, demanding that he immediately cease any resistance against the Emperor and the Imperial Catholic Church. The letter also takes care to praise the Pope for recognizing the times and wisely retreating.\n\nThe Imperial Diet has been convened and declared that the Imperial Catholic Church, led by the Emperor and the Imperial Pope, is the only legitimate faith of the Holy Roman Empire. The privileges of electors who follow other religions will be revoked, and the Emperor has been granted the authority to forcibly convert princes to the Imperial Catholic Church."
DD_HRE_57a: "Thus, a farce has come to an end."
