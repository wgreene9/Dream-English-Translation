DD_HRE_6_t: "Heinrich Decree"
DD_HRE_6_d: "Every Hohenstaufen Emperor understood that without shattering the chains left by the Lombard Wars, neither the Empire nor their dynasty could ever become true rulers of Europa. The Treaty of Rome - a mere contract that bound the double-headed eagle's empire under the rule of the triple crown and heavenly keys. As imperial ambitions rose again from the graves of past defeats, relations between the Papacy and Emperor steadily deteriorated.\n\nAt last, the Holy Roman Empire welcomed another ambitious emperor. [Root.Monarch.GetName] would stop at nothing to reclaim the powers usurped by the Church. A highly controversial decree was brought before the Imperial Diet, demanding sacramental autonomy free from papal interference, jurisdiction over clergy within imperial territories, and limitations on papal authority within the Empire.\n\nDue to its resemblance to the Investiture Controversy of old, the Emperor's opponents mockingly associated his decree with the name of Heinrich IV, the imperial ruler of that time. Yet the Emperor himself embraced this comparison. He was determined to enforce his Heinrich Decree and become the true, holy, anointed ruler and master of the Empire."

DD_HRE_8_t: "The Rising Storm"
DD_HRE_8_d: "Through unyielding measures, aggressive posturing, and overwhelming influence, the Papacy has proven itself as formidable as it was centuries ago. The Emperor was forced to submit to the Church just as Heinrich IV had done, suffering utter humiliation. Like storm clouds blotting out the sun, the Church's shadow seems permanently cast over the Empire and all of Europa.\n\nThis has left reformist clergy and progressive theologians seething with disappointment and rage. Theology professors across universities now openly (or discreetly) criticize the Church, while lower-ranking clergy preach against papal policies. The princes meanwhile privately catalogue the Church's corruption and misdeeds. Though the Papacy may have won this battle in the Imperial Diet, another storm is gathering in the mire - one whose fury has only just begun."
DD_HRE_8a: "You may command the law, but you can never shackle thought."

DD_HRE_9_t: "First Amendment"
DD_HRE_9_d: "While the Emperor's decree gained support from most princes, the Electors - whose power stems from the Golden Bull - viewed it with deep suspicion. They feared that after the Papacy's era ends, they would become the next lambs for slaughter in the Emperor's power consolidation.\n\nThus, several secular Electors jointly proposed an amended version - the First Amendment to the Heinrich Decree. It demands the Emperor guarantee the sacred hereditary rights and electoral status of all Imperial princes, especially the Electors, protecting their God-given privileges from unjust interference."
DD_HRE_9a: "Ratify the Imperial First Amendment."
DD_HRE_9b: "Reject the amendment - this is opportunism."

DD_HRE_10_t: "Ecclesiastical Protest"
DD_HRE_10_d: "As expected, passage of the Heinrich Decree provoked fierce protests from Rome. The Pope vehemently condemned the Empire's blasphemous and shameless acts, almost immediately suspending sacraments in Imperial territories and threatening excommunication for the Emperor. Though not yet taking the ultimate measures, all negotiations and exchanges became mere formalities - a Second Great Schism now appears inevitable."
DD_HRE_10a: "Let us wait and see."

DD_HRE_11_t: "Sunset Over the Sea"
DD_HRE_11_d: "It is over. The fate of Northern Germany has reached its end. Their delusions, their aspirations, their ambitions and fury - all have sunk into the North Sea along with Northern Germany's destruction. The Hanseatic League too has been buried, descending into a cold and wretched grave. Once-glorious crests, lofty banners, and sails filled with northern winds have all turned to worthless dust. A proud and free alliance has ultimately found its path to despair and enslavement.\n\nThe Hanseatic League has ceased resistance. All cities have lost contact with Lübeck, inevitably collapsing. Merchant ships that once dominated the seas were reduced to wreckage and dust under roaring cannon fire. Their vaunted maritime bulwark, much like their arrogant alliance, has sunk like a dying sun into the North Sea, forever lost to the depths. The ocean that was their cradle shall now be their tomb."
DD_HRE_11a: "They were great once."

DD_HRE_12_t: "The Iron Curtain Falls"
DD_HRE_12_d: "Since the Hohenstaufens ascended the throne, the Iron Century they forged - built upon war, intrigue, blood and hegemony - endured for hundreds of years. They ruled the Empire as eternal emperors, dominating Europe's order. None dared imagine a future after this dynasty's fall, as if their reign was as immutable as the sun and moon.\n\nNow, with the Hohenstaufen defeat, the dynasty's iron curtain crumbles like quicksand. Their proud Iron Century finally meets its end, becoming just another dusty heraldic device in ancient tomes. The Empire has expelled the old dynasty's emperor, returning to traditions predating the iron curtain's rise by restoring the ancient imperial elections. After centuries, the Holy Roman Emperor shall once again be chosen by election, determined by the Electors' will."

DD_HRE_50_t: "The Second Great Schism"
# DD_HRE_50_d: "Since the beginning of the Crusades, the cooperation between the Empire and the Papacy has been intimate. Every crusade has been backed by the full support of the Empire and the Papacy. The Empire protects Christendom while expanding its lands, and the Papacy endorses the Empire's rule, continuously extending the Church's authority and influence. People once thought that such an unstoppable era would continue indefinitely.\n\nWhen everything reaches its peak, contradictions accumulate. Although the Pope resides under the Empire's protection, he still maintains his supreme secular authority. The Emperor needs anointed coronation, the Holy See's recognition, divine rule, and unchallengeable power. The Pope uses this as leverage, obstructing the Emperor's power development within the Empire for years while expanding the Church's influence. In $YEAR$, the Emperor, unable to bear it any longer, issued the 'Sacramental Autonomy Act,' stipulating that the sacraments within the Holy Roman Empire would be arranged according to imperial law and the Diet. Not even Christ's vicar on earth could interfere. This move thoroughly enraged the Pope, as the Church's dissatisfaction with the Emperor had long been an open secret. He publicly summoned his supporters, announced the excommunication of the Emperor, and called for the election of an anti-Emperor. Although the Pope believed the Church's influence was as powerful as it had been centuries ago, the Church's era had long passed.\n\nThe humiliation of Canossa did not repeat itself. The current Emperor is not as flexible as Henry IV, but like Henry IV, he is vengeful. The Emperor convened the Diet, declaring the Pope to be licentious, corrupting the Church, blaspheming God, and coveting secular power, unworthy of being Christ's vicar. He installed an anti-Pope—the Archbishop of Cologne. German religious affairs should be managed by a German Pope.\n\nThe major powers of Europe have been watching for a long time, and this time, they do not mind adding fuel to the fire of the Holy Roman Empire—preferably burning it to ashes."
DD_HRE_50_d: "Since the Crusades began, the Empire and Papacy had maintained an intimate collaboration. Behind every crusade stood their combined efforts - the Empire protecting Christendom while expanding its borders, while the Papacy legitimized imperial rule and extended ecclesiastical authority. Many believed this era would last forever.\n\nYet at the peak of their cooperation, tensions simmered beneath. Though sheltering under imperial protection, the Pope retained his supreme temporal authority. Emperors needed anointed coronations, papal recognition, sacred legitimacy, and unchallenged power. Using this as leverage, successive popes had constrained imperial authority while extending Church influence throughout the Empire. In $YEAR$, the Emperor could tolerate no more. He issued the Sacramental Autonomy Act - better known by its ironic popular name, the 'Heinrich Decree' - declaring that imperial sacraments would follow imperial law and parliamentary arrangements alone. Not even Christ's Vicar could interfere.\n\nThis final provocation enraged the Pope, whose grievances against the Emperor were already an open secret. He publicly rallied supporters, excommunicated the Emperor, and called for electing an anti-Emperor. Though the Pope believed Church influence remained as absolute as centuries past, the age of ecclesiastical supremacy had long faded.\n\nNo Canossa humiliation would repeat. Today's Emperor lacked Heinrich IV's flexibility but shared his vindictiveness. Convening the Diet, he denounced the Pope as debauched, corrupt, blasphemous, and power-hungry - unworthy of being Christ's Vicar. He installed a rival Pope - the Archbishop of Cologne - declaring German religious affairs would be governed by a German Pope.\n\nEurope's great powers watched intently.
