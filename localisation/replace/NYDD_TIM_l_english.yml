 DD_TIM_1_t: "The Death of Guo Jinglun"
 DD_TIM_1_d: "Guo Jinglun, the military governor of Khorasan and former deputy to Wei Huo, is dead. His death has thrown all of Khorasan into chaos."
 DD_TIM_1a: "Leave it to fate."
 DD_TIM_1a_tt: ""
 DD_TIM_2_t: "Strike While the Iron is Hot"
 DD_TIM_2_d: "With General Guo's death, Khorasan has descended into disorder. This may be an opportune moment to seize Golestan Fortress."
 DD_TIM_2a: "So be it."
 DD_TIM_2b: "Without the Inspector's special permission, we should not act rashly."
 DD_TIM_3_t: "The Second Persian War"
 DD_TIM_3_d: "Nearly half a century has passed since Wei Huo's great conquest ended, yet the bloody authority we built from skull mounds and rivers of blood still looms over Persia's skies. But this prolonged peace has nearly erased our terror and might from the feeble minds of the Mongols and their Persian lapdogs—these disloyal barbarians, devoid of honor or shame, already prepare to stab their masters in the back.\n\nHad those treacherous Mongols not slain the Grand General through vile deceit, we would not need to don our armor once more. But only blood can wash away disgrace; only death can etch lessons into memory. If the descendants of Chagatai cannot uphold the teachings of their ancestors, then let us teach these uncivilized border savages a lesson through a ruthless and brutal war. Let them learn what it means: 'The sovereign's law and the father's order—hierarchy and discipline.'"
 DD_TIM_3a: "Expel the barbarians, avenge our shame—pile their skulls high!"
