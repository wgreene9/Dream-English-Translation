Having lost much of its territory, it now survives amidst encirclement. The rulers of §YBadajoz§! care little for any authority; they are indifferent to nobility and honor. For them, the only right path is to seize the opportunity to eliminate the other Taifas, inherit the legacy of the Umayyads, and unify all of Al-Andalus. As for the Nasrids of §YGranada§!, they are passionate about the claim to the Caliphate, rallying and uniting fervent believers as their means to victory. Undoubtedly, they are deeply interested in the supreme position of Al-Andalus...\n\nAll of Iberia, all of Al-Andalus, now lies under a shadow. The war horn has been raised, waiting for the moment to sound its fury. The future of this region remains obscure. Perhaps the Christian kingdoms, experiencing a great revival, will once again unify Iberia; perhaps the Muslim Taifas, still holding onto hope, will have a chance to place Al-Andalus under the rule of Allah; or perhaps, both will become dust beneath the wheels of history..."

Outdated inheritance laws still plague this nascent nation like a festering wound. The Gonzalez family must use every means to escape this shadow, so they can once again lead the Christians in holding high the torch that illuminates the darkness. The region of Galicia is ruled by Carlos's brother, §YSancho§!, who together with Carlos rose to power. The hardships they endured along the way are too numerous to recount. Sancho does not covet the throne of Asturias but is instead obsessed with navigation. In Galicia, with its maritime traditions, he is like a fish in water, often leading naval expeditions himself, even attempting to cross the Strait of Gibraltar to pilgrimage to Jerusalem. His spirit of adventure is commendable, but Carlos's sons have long seen him as a potential enemy. If he cannot stay out of the fray, they will undoubtedly have to turn against each other.\n\n§YJimena of Navarre§! is eyeing everything. They once controlled most of Iberia, with many royal titles in their hands. But after the king's sudden death during the Iberian Union, they lost everything. The bloody civil war among the northern Christian kingdoms only ended a few years ago with the unification under the Gonzalez family. Now, the Jimena family is merely huddled in the mountains of Navarre, their eyes red with envy as they gaze at the lands of Asturias, their former rightful territory. They will stop at nothing, using any means, no matter how dirty, to reclaim it!\n\nThe §YPrince of Aragon§! has always been in this awkward position, caught between the influence of the French, the northern civil war, and the Muslim threat. Thanks to the protection of the empire, they seem detached from the conflicts of Iberia, but they face even greater troubles. The local council of §YValencia§! is effectively independent. Even if they choose to have an Aragonese prince rule, it would only be in name, with the more likely outcome being the election of a local noble. On the other hand, the empire and their French lapdogs have gradually lost patience. They see no sincerity from the Aragonese, having sent envoys multiple times hoping to make Aragon one of the many crowns. With all these challenges before them, where should Aragon go?"

Caliphate, the Taifa kingdoms have been in constant conflict, with no single ruler able to unify and dominate all of Al-Andalus with unchallenged authority.\n\nThe prolonged division marked the twilight of the Muslims, yet as the sun sets in the west, those in the east will greet the dawn.\n\n§YMallorca, Menorca, and Ibiza§! may just be three small islands that no one cares about. But for the local people, they are the endpoint of a lifetime of wandering.\n\n§YMenorca§! was an ideal escape. The Islamic §YKharijites§!, who adhered strictly to the true teachings of Islam, were unwelcome by the Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties, forcing them to wander. The last large group of survivors fled to the §YBalearic Islands§! during the Umayyad conquest and settled there, gradually forming a relatively prosperous community.\n\n§YMallorca§! was a vow to return home. The inhabitants of Mallorca came from distant §YEngland§!. During the great §YNorman Conquest§! and §YViking invasions§!, in the inevitable collapse, they fled, wandered, and declined the offer of the §YByzantine§! Empire (which promised them a territory in Crimea), eventually arriving at the large eastern island of Mallorca in chaotic Iberia. They defeated the local Muslim regime, driving them to the eastern island of Menorca, and began to call themselves New England.\n\n§YIbiza§! was a journey of necessity. These Vikings came from the §Y13th§! century Crusades, when the North Sea Empire had already converted to Christianity but still retained many Norse believers. These people followed the fleet to the Mediterranean, stunned by the wealth there. Simply put, they couldn't move on. Many Vikings deserted the fleet and began pillaging Iberia. Of course, this was all part of the North Sea Empire's plan to leave these '§Yprimitive barbarians§!' here. In any case, Ibiza gradually became a Viking pirate stronghold.\n\nThen, another grand invasion began. If the collapse of the §YUmayyads§! marked the first act of the §YTaifa Era§!, then the grand invasion of the §YAlmoravid§! Dynasty opened the second act of Iberian chaos. As if by fate, while El Cid led a surprise attack on Ceuta, the Almoravid Dynasty's hastily assembled fleet also embarked on a journey to surprise Valencia. However, this ragtag group of soldiers completely lost their way, arriving days later than expected. As they approached the coast of Valencia, the Christians on the shore were celebrating the great success of the surprise attack. Knowing that victory was hopeless, the captain ordered a retreat. But the crew, mostly slaves, refused, knowing that such a grave mistake would mean certain death upon return. So this lost Almoravid fleet turned towards the Balearics, intending to seize it as a haven and turn to piracy.\n\nAs land came into view, a joint fleet of Englishmen, Muslims, and Vikings unexpectedly blocked their path. After some friendly exchanges, mostly by the Kharijites preaching equality and brotherhood, the fleet agreed to join the island alliance, but only the Muslim group on Menorca.\n\n§MThe Present§!\nFor four hundred years, the inhabitants of New England have dreamed of returning home, the Muslims of Menorca have fantasized about an equal Ummah, and the Vikings have only cared about money. But the current situation is far from satisfactory. The alliance is good, but it is only an alliance. In this era, the Balearic Islands need someone to break the status quo and unify the islands. Only then can their story take a turn for the better."

string_start_DD_north_africa: "§OThe Past§!\nThe Crusader Kingdoms of North Africa originated from the adventurous Norman lords, Count Roger I of Sicily and his talented son's victorious expedition to Ifriqiya. The Muslims of North Africa were crushed by the Crusader armies, and the Kingdom of Africa stood tall on the lands of the Berbers. The fragmented remnants of Ifriqiya were forced to retreat deep into the Sahara Desert, surviving through tribal guerrilla warfare and sporadic aid from Egypt.\n\nIn the west, the Mauritanian Crusader Kingdom came from the legendary Iberian knight Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, the epic hero El Cid. He was tasked with crossing the sea to cut off the retreat of the Almoravid Dynasty and launch an attack on their homeland, where he remained stationed. The Almoravids, defeated by the Iberian Taifas and the Reconquista states, eventually crumbled, and the surviving tribes retreated into the sands of the Western Sahara. Over generations, Mauritania developed into an independent Crusader Kingdom, ruling over the lands of Morocco.\n\nThe two Crusader Kingdoms of North Africa formed a holy alliance, attacking the remaining Muslim forces from both east and west, ultimately bringing all of North Africa under the glory of the Holy Father. After the extinction of the Hauteville family in Sicily, the throne of the Kingdom of Sicily was seized by the Hohenstaufen heirs, while the throne of Africa was inherited by the descendants of El Cid, who had intermarried with the royal family for generations. The Norman branch of the family continued to hold the position of Grand Master of Cyrenaica, serving the kingdom loyally.\n\n§MThe Present§!\nAfrica was once a prosperous Catholic nation. Under the cold-blooded rule of Rodrigo III, he implemented a strong centralized monarchy, forcing the Moors under his rule to either convert or face death. The power of the kingdom was concentrated in the hands of the king, whose will was unquestionable.\n\nUnfortunately, his successor, the Mad King Diego, plunged the kingdom into chaos. In his early years, he indulged in pleasure and ignored governance, living a reckless and promiscuous life. In his later years, he struggled with madness and hysteria. The capricious king rarely attended to state affairs. During his long reign, the kingdom sank into corruption and decline. Despite the Cyrenaican legions guarding the borders, the Sultan of Egypt and the Crusader brethren in the Holy Land never ceased their covetous gaze upon Africa.\n\nUnder the long Christian rule, Muslim lords never extinguished the torch of rebellion. Several years ago, the Great Muslim Uprising won freedom for the devout Muslims of Morocco. The governor of Mauritania is still struggling to hold on, but the fragile Crusader rule seems to be cracking. The Cyrenaican legions can no longer tolerate the kingdom's chaos, and the tribes in the desert seem to see the smoke on the horizon, signaling the call for a counterattack."

string_start_DD_iberian_ARA: "§OThe Past§!\nWhen the flames of the Albigensian Crusade consumed the fields of southern France, the bronze doors of the Aragonese court echoed with the urgent knocks of exiled nobles. Pedro II, the Protector, knew he could not directly confront the combined forces of the Holy Roman Emperor and the Pope, so he turned a 'Protection Edict' into a shield, sheltering the persecuted heretics and nobles under his wing. The exiles brought not only gold and swords but also the wisdom of the Provençals, forging Iberian blades—Aragon's banners were planted on the walls of Valencia, pointing towards the struggling Taifas in the south.\n\nHowever, no pure roses bloomed in the thorny thicket of protection. The schism between Cathar believers and Catholic knights spread across the countryside, and Latin conspiracies clung to the court's pillars like poisonous vines. When Pedro II attempted to revoke the 'Protection Edict' to mend the divide, the powder keg he ignited finally exploded—in 1213, during the bells of St. John's Day, the steps of Barcelona Cathedral were stained with the king's blood. The five-year-old James I cowered in the shadow of the throne, witnessing the rebel banners of Valencia tear through the southern frontier. Ultimately, the peninsula's nobles quelled the chaos with an iron fist, but the crown of the new king was already entwined with the chains of the Latin faction, forcing Aragon to stumble forward in a quagmire of compromise.\n\n§MThe Present§!\nThe leader of the peninsula faction, Fernando II the Pious, now holds the scepter of balance. He soothes the temporarily pacified Latin faction with honeyed words while using the sword to quell the ambitions of the disloyal, bringing a brief return of peace and glory to the kingdom. But the cold winds of the Pyrenees never cease—the lion of Asturias covets Aragon's crown, and the lilies of the French princes seek to extend their roots into the cracks of Catalonia. Deeper shadows loom from the south and the sea—the Muslim Taifas and North African pirates weave their sails across the western Mediterranean, as if reminding this monarch: If Aragon cannot become the player of Iberia, it will ultimately become a pawn on someone else's chessboard."

string_start_DD_crusder_state: "§OThe Past§!\nThe great victory of the Crusades opened a bright future for Christians yearning for the Holy Land. After the disastrous defeat at Manzikert, the helpless Alexios I had no choice but to seek help from his Catholic brethren. The arriving Crusaders successfully took advantage of the chaos following the death of Malik Shah I, capturing Edessa and Antioch. The dying Fatimid Dynasty in the south was powerless to stop the formidable Frankish armies, while the chaotic Seljuk Empire was too preoccupied with Anatolia to intervene. Thus, four Crusader states—the County of Edessa, the County of Tripoli, the Principality of Antioch, and the Kingdom of Jerusalem—were established on the ruins of Muslim rule.\n\nBut the good times did not last. The famous Saladin rose from Egypt, overthrowing the incompetent Fatimids and launching a fierce counterattack against the Crusaders. Under the reckless command of Gerard de Ridefort, the Grand Master of the Templars, Saladin nearly annihilated the Crusaders at the Battle of Hattin. The County of Edessa was destroyed, the northern Crusader states were pushed back, and Muslims even briefly occupied Jerusalem.\n\nMeanwhile, a new Crusade appeared on the horizon. King Philip II of France and Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I successfully reached the Holy Land, and the united Crusaders managed to save the beleaguered kingdom, though reclaiming all lost territories remained a daunting task. They successfully captured Cyprus, which had rebelled against Byzantium, and once again expanded the kingdom's borders along the Palestinian coast. After Saladin's death, his descendants fought fiercely over his Near Eastern inheritance, and the Crusaders seized the opportunity to capture Egypt.\n\nHowever, the isolated Crusaders were eventually defeated by the Ayyubid successors, losing Egypt once again. In 1228, Frederick II, the grandson of Barbarossa and heir to the Kingdom of Jerusalem, arrived in the Holy Land. With the Pope's strong support, the emperor ended the chaotic succession disputes in Jerusalem and took on the glory of protecting the Holy Sepulchre. He allied with Sultan al-Kamil of Egypt, successfully defeating his eastern brother and capturing Damascus, ultimately ending the long-standing religious wars in the Holy Land through a controversial marriage alliance.\n\nAfter this astonishing peace, Sultan al-Kamil stabilized Egypt's politics, firmly establishing Ayyubid rule and consolidating military and political power in his hands. The Hohenstaufen heirs led the Crusaders in further campaigns, defeating the Turks and capturing southern Anatolia. After al-Kamil's death, his successors maintained a long peace with the Crusaders until the Syrian governor, allied with the Bedouins, launched a rebellion. The Egyptian Sultan, preoccupied with a succession crisis, could only watch as Jerusalem occupied his lands under the pretext of quelling the rebellion. Meanwhile, the Syrian ruler, though raising the banner of Jihad, could only retain a small portion of his territory.\n\n§MThe Present§!\nToday, the Ayyubid heirs in the Sahara Desert eye the Crusaders in the Holy Land, hoping to restore their ancestors' glory. The small kingdom of Jerusalem is once again shrouded in the shadow of succession disputes, as a young queen's rule fails to quell the ambitions of power-hungry factions. Arab Muslims and northern Crusader states alike vie for their share of the land."

string_start_DD_france_kingdom: "§OThe Past§!\nThe Norman Conquest was undoubtedly the most glorious victory in French history and the pinnacle of this once-pitiful kingdom. William the Conqueror, the first Norman Duke of England, secured the rich lands of Britain, which became a source of pride for the French Kingdom. However, the stubborn resistance of the English and the ever-watchful Norse raiders forced the kingdom to halt its expansion across the channel and instead focus on consolidating its existing territories.\n\nDuring the subsequent Crusades, the kingdom served as the sword of God. This prosperous nation seemed destined to dedicate everything to the Holy Father's cause. Enthusiastic crowds filled the streets, noble lords rode off to distant lands, and the mission to liberate the Holy Land became an urgent calling. Under the leadership of Louis, son of Philip I, the Crusaders vowed to expel the Saracens from the Holy Sepulchre, with the mighty and sacred France leading the charge. Under the Capetian dynasty, adorned with fleurs-de-lis, France's glory seemed to reign supreme over the two seas and the vast lands of Europe.\n\nUnfortunately, God had other plans. France's wars were not as smooth as those of its Christian brethren. Prolonged conflicts, exorbitant ransoms, and discord among the nobility led to the kingdom's gradual decline. Louis VI, returning from the Holy Land, struggled to control the nobility, and the Cathar heresy in the south sang the dirge of its demise. The Holy Roman Empire and the emperor's retinue assembled a so-called Crusade, invading French lands, while the southern nobles resolved to resist this aggression, dragging Philip II's France into the fray.\n\nWhen the dust settled, blood and bones filled France's trenches, and the southern lands no longer belonged to this once-mighty kingdom. Louis IX of the Capetian dynasty and John the Incompetent, the Angevin Duke of England who inherited the Norman legacy, died in the bloody battles of Poitou. The ancient Capetian dynasty was deposed by the emperor, and a new French Kingdom was carved from the corpse of the old, ruled by the Hohenstaufen emperor over the southern subjects. In the midst of this collapse, the young Henry III of England took up the sacred crown, struggling to hold together a kingdom in ruins, hoping for its eventual rebirth. However, the rebellion of English outlaws forced Henry III to sign the Magna Carta, relinquishing power in England.\n\nAfter the disaster, the Angevin kings cautiously attempted to rebuild the kingdom, slowly strengthening the central authority in Paris. They nearly succeeded, were it not for the terrible succession war. Edward the Black Prince, son of Edward III, died young during his father's dispute with imperial princes over the Low Countries. The young Richard II was placed under the regency of his uncle, John of Valois. In the ensuing power struggle, the king imprisoned the regent and confiscated his estates, but John's son, Henry of Valois, escaped and seized control of Paris while Richard was campaigning in Brittany, reigniting the flames of civil war.\n\nHelpless, Richard II had to turn to the nobles his predecessors had long suppressed. After a protracted civil war, Richard II finally secured his throne, but at the cost of once again decentralizing power to the nobility. Henry, who had reached an agreement with the king, also received a dignified outcome, though he had to cede his title to his brother, his family remained prosperous.\n\n§MThe Present§!\nDespite the ongoing turmoil in the north and the nobles' independent actions, the King of France will not submit to such a fate. A true French Kingdom must rise from past humiliations, and neither English remnants, Norse raiders, nor the empire's detestable schemers can hinder France's greatness. The absurd alliance of the Low Countries and England looms in the north, awaiting France's reclaiming of its glory.\n\nIn the southern kingdom under imperial rule, it is effectively a 'Free' Kingdom jointly governed by the Dukes of Gascony, Burgundy, and Provence. Though nominally subject to the emperor, southern politics are dictated by the three dukes. Burgundy and Provence share a common heritage from the Kingdom of Arles, while the Duke of Gascony has long been the uncrowned king of the south. For centuries, the three dukes have fought among themselves while outwardly submitting to the emperor's authority. Behind the dark curtain, the three dukes are staging a drama of intrigue and betrayal.\n\nAs the emperor's power wanes, the loosening chains in the south have led the dukes to set their sights further afield. Undoubtedly, France needs consolidation, but who will be the victor on the throne? Cooperation or competition, loyalty or betrayal—will they vie for the Roman crown or step back to pursue France's more enduring glory?"

string_start_DD_north_sea_empire: "§OThe Past§!\nScandinavia, the land of the Vikings, once saw King Cnut the Great attempt to establish a unified North Sea Empire, but it dissolved after his death.\n\nAs a descendant of Harald Bluetooth, King Harald III of Norway demonstrated bravery rivaling his ancestors. After returning from the Byzantine Empire and seizing the throne, Norway began to flourish. He invaded Denmark in 1062, capturing the Danish throne, and in 1066, he accepted William the Conqueror's proposal to jointly invade England. Harald the Great led Viking elites across the seas, overcoming logistical challenges and the disadvantages of fighting on foreign soil. Along the way, commoners welcomed them, nobles placed their bets, and Scotland and Northumbria joined the mighty Viking army. Fortunately, the weather favored them, and William's forces landed successfully in England, facing little resistance from Harold's English army. Hearing of Harald's approach to London, Harold hastily marched north to confront him, culminating in the Battle of Stamford Bridge. The English army initially used archers, but their arrows were blocked by Viking shields. Harald himself, protected by the Varangian Guard, charged into the enemy ranks. The English army was routed, and Harold's body was later found in a nearby ditch.\n\nHarald honored his agreement with William, possibly due to the efforts of the French king and the Pope, and the two decided to maintain their occupied lands, dividing England between them. Harald returned triumphant, his prestige at its peak, and he declared the reestablishment of the North Sea Empire, much like Cnut the Great had done. In 1071, he invaded Sweden, reaching Finland. Thanks to his brother Olaf's fervent promotion of Christianity, many Norse believers fled to Sweden and Finland, and Harald's invasion alienated the Swedes, who refused to convert and clung to their faith in Odin.\n\nIn 1075, the greatest Viking, the last Viking, Harald the Ruthless, passed away peacefully in Oslo. He ushered in a new Viking era, a new power—the North Sea Empire.\n\nBut the empire's glory was short-lived. Over the following decades, the lack of internal and external conflicts led to the army's corruption—recruit quality declined, upper officers became monopolized by the nobility, and ambitious young officers faced suppression and persecution. By the time Olaf III took power, the famous 'Rebellion of Rebekah' made him distrust the army, leading to massive cuts in the standing army and misallocation of military funds. Mercenaries, loyal only to wealth and not to the crown, became the empire's most relied-upon hounds, while the remaining imperial guard was heavily distrusted and suppressed. Beneath the vast empire lay conflicts between Christians and Norse believers, prolonged ethnic strife and division among Norway, Denmark, and Sweden, and the high autonomy of the Danish-controlled territories overseas...\n\n§MThe Present§!\nSweden, Finland, and Novgorod have long been deeply rooted in Odin's faith, breaking away from the North Sea Empire. The empire now consists only of Norway, Denmark, and the Danish-controlled territories, but even these are unstable: the governor of the Danish territories has not reported for months, clearly harboring rebellious intentions; the Swedes covet their former lands, determined to reclaim them; due to the German wars, the Hanseatic League disbanded, and the alliance between Denmark and Norway is gradually becoming competitive; the Angevin kings of France are also attempting to reclaim their ancestral claims and unify England; perhaps only the English remnants—the Five Provinces Alliance—are still happily making money.\n\nHowever, the current king, Olaf III Harald, struggles to govern such a vast empire. He is enamored with the art of the court, turning a deaf ear to the rebellions outside.\n\nThe North Sea Empire is like a ship on the verge of collapse, sailing through turbulent waters..."

In 1180, Bavaria was again transferred by Frederick I to §YOtto I§! of the §YWittelsbach§! family, who had rendered outstanding service to the emperor during the Crusades, as compensation for the Babenberg family's elevation of Styria to the Duchy of Austria. In the early 13th century, through a marriage alliance with Henry V, Bavaria gained the title of §YCount Palatine of the Rhine§!, forming the Palatine branch of the Wittelsbach family. Around the same time, the §YAlbigensian Crusade§! forced France to submit to the Empire, and the southern French territories ruled in the emperor's name marked the Hohenstaufen family's rise to its peak. In the distant East, the charismatic §YFrederick II§!, grandson of Barbarossa, defied opposition and preserved the Crusader cause through a marriage alliance with Egypt's §YAl-Kamil§!, becoming a hero of Christendom and forcing even the Pope to compromise with him.\n\nIn §Y1236§!, §YFrederick II§! of the Babenberg family was expelled from Austria by the emperor due to his harsh management of family members and territories, as well as his strained relationship with the emperor, and he eventually died in the Holy Land. The Wittelsbach family inherited Austria, which had no heir, but in doing so, they were forced to sign the §YTreaty of Munich§! with the emperor, stipulating that the Wittelsbachs could never merge Bavaria and Austria. In §Y1254§!, Emperor §YConrad IV§! once again invaded the §YLombard League§!. Although the Pope's attitude toward the emperor was ambiguous, it still provoked strong resistance from the Italian princes. In §Y1268§!, Conrad IV died of fever, and his son Conradin faced the first disaster that shook the Hohenstaufen dynasty—the §YGreat Imperial Rebellion§!.\n\nDespite Conradin's pious demeanor, his widespread popularity, and his grandfather's significant contributions to the Holy Land and the Crusades, the Papacy could not excommunicate him. However, the Holy See unequivocally supported the rebellion against the emperor. The rebels, eyeing the imperial throne, joined forces with the Lombard League to launch a rebellion that swept across the Empire. In the end, Conradin had to seek support from other princes and compromise with the Papacy. The resulting §YTreaty of Rome§! stipulated that the emperor would relinquish interference in Italy, while the Papacy would hold absolute and supreme theological independence, with even the emperor barred from interfering in theological and sacramental matters. To secure the princes' support, Conradin reluctantly signed the §YGolden Bull§!, which enshrined the sacred rights of the princes and the Church, granting §YBohemia§!, §YBrandenburg§!, §Ythe Palatinate§!, §YSaxony§!, and the §YThree Archbishoprics§! the power to elect the emperor.\n\nRegardless, the Hohenstaufen family ultimately survived this crisis, though the Empire's future remained precarious. With the emperor's threat removed, the Lombard League gradually disintegrated, while the northern princes rose to prominence in the wake of the §YWendish Crusade§!. After the extinction of the Ascanian line, the Hohenzollern family of Ansbach inherited the Margraviate of Brandenburg. Following the Great Imperial Rebellion, the emperor temporarily lost control over the Empire's frontiers, and the §YHanseatic League§! gradually dominated northern trade, with North Germany rising from the Empire's ruins.\n\nFinally, in §Y1324§!, the ambitious northern princes once again set their sights on the imperial throne. A North German alliance led by the §YMargrave of Brandenburg§!, the §YDuke of Saxony§!, and the §YHanseatic League§! was formed, and the calamity known as the §YGerman Civil War§! struck the Empire once more, ultimately without a clear victor. In the aftermath, the Count Palatine of the Wittelsbach family was stripped of his title for participating in the rebellion, and it was transferred to the emperor's loyalists, the §YHabsburg§! family. Bavaria also gradually lost its influence over southern Tyrol. North Germany was forced to secede from the Empire, and the electoral titles of Brandenburg and Saxony were granted to §YBavaria§! and the §YLombard League§!, who had supported the emperor.\n\nIn §Y1335§!, the last male heir of Tyrol, §YHenry VI of Carinthia§!, passed away, and his daughter, the Countess of Tyrol, married into the Hohenzollern family of Ansbach. Eventually, the Tyrolean branch of this family fully controlled the §YCounty of Tyrol§! amidst the chaos of the Alps.\n\n§MThe Present§!\nToday, the Hohenstaufen influence continues to decline, and the South German princes, once loyal or indifferent, are once again turning their gaze toward the imperial throne. This crown, which seemed eternally destined for the Hohenstaufen eagle, is now surrounded by endless rebels and rival emperors. Although the Hohenstaufen heir ultimately retained the throne through the dynasty's formidable strength, the emperor's authority over the Empire is no longer what it once was.\n\nThe princes of southern France can no longer tolerate the rule of a German emperor, the Italian states will not miss this rare opportunity, the wealthy Low Countries remain ambiguous and indifferent toward the Empire, and even the Hohenstaufen branch in the Holy Land no longer wishes to deal with their Swabian relatives. Even Bohemia, the only truly neutral and peaceful realm, has sown the seeds of chaos with the Hussite and Taborite rebellions. Fortunately, the political marriage between Emperor §YFrederick III§! and Bavaria's §YBarbara II§! continues to maintain the alliance between Swabia and Bavaria.

However, after the death of the Grand Vizier §YNizam al-Mulk§!, the Nizari sect from Alamut Castle, led by §YHassan-i Sabbah§!, repeatedly assassinated key figures of the empire, greatly exacerbating the already severe succession crisis. The §YSultanate of Rum§! declared independence in Anatolia. The increasingly declining Seljuk Sultan could no longer hold back the Mongol onslaught. Finally, the Seljuks, holed up in Erzurum, chose to §Ysubmit§! to the Mongols, becoming vassals under the Great Khan and serving as his tax collectors in Anatolia.\n\nTo the west of Anatolia, the Sultan of Rum also lived in fear under the shadow of the Mongols. The §YCrusaders§! from across the strait decisively defeated the remnants of the Roman Empire, landed on the mainland, and marched eastward. Caught between the Mongols and the Frankish armies, the Sultanate of Rum inevitably fell into disarray. The Sultan and the coastal Turkic nobles chose to bow to the Crusaders, convert to §YCatholicism§!, and pledge allegiance to their new ruler in New Rome. From then on, the descendants of the Seljuks completely lost control of the inland regions, and Anatolia became a fragmented land.\n\nBut even the Crusaders could not withstand the Mongol advance. After conquering Persia, the Mongols continued their march toward Aleppo and Arabia. The Crusader coalition struggled to achieve victory on the battlefield, but the chaotic internal affairs of the Mongols gave them a brief respite. Ultimately, the §YKingdom of Jerusalem§! ruled Syria and the south in the name of the Mongol Empire, paying tribute to the Great Khan. The chaos wrought by war created a rare opportunity for Anatolia, and a small tribe named §YOsman§! emerged onto the historical stage.\n\nThe Osman tribe had long fought as mercenaries for both Turks and Greeks. During the invasion of §YCroatia§! against §YBulgaria§!, §YOrhan I§! of the Osman tribe took advantage of the chaos to seize §YGallipoli§!. Over time, the Ottomans gradually absorbed the remnants of the Sultanate of Rum and expanded eastward, subduing both the Seljuks and the Rum, nearly unifying Anatolia.\n\n§MThe Present§!\nUnfortunately, the Ottomans were not the only ones to rise amidst the chaos. A lame, Turkicized Mongol warlord named §YTimur§! emerged from Transoxiana. He and his army conquered Persia and Khorasan within a few years, then marched westward, directly confronting the Ottomans. In the §Y1402§! Battle of Ankara, the Ottoman ruler §YBayezid I 'the Thunderbolt'§! was captured alive by Timur, and the Anatolian empire he had built collapsed in an instant. Warlords across the land declared independence, and the previously subjugated Rum and Seljuks pledged allegiance to Timur.\n\nHowever, in an unexpected turn of events, Timur drank too much at his victory banquet and, ignoring dissuasion, insisted on riding his horse at full speed, ultimately falling to his death. After Timur's death, his empire lacked a strong successor, and his vast but loosely held realm quickly fell into disarray. His subordinates and previously conquered vassals declared independence. §YMuhammad§!, the son of Bayezid I who had died in prison, immediately returned to his homeland, defeated his brothers, and reestablished the Ottoman dynasty.

The caliphs of §YFatimid§! and §YAbbasid§! vied for the title of orthodoxy, never imagining that one day they would both be buried in the sands of Arabia. In the late Fatimid period, frequent succession crises and the powerful viziers led to several schisms within the Shiite community. In §Y1130§!, the Fatimid Imam Amir was assassinated by the Nizari of Alamut, and his young son §YTayyib§! became the new caliph. However, Amir's cousin §YAbd al-Majid§! usurped the position of Imam and Caliph, taking the title §YHafiz§!, and Tayyib disappeared, presumed dead.\n\nIn fact, Tayyib did not die that night of turmoil. Under the escort of Yemen's chief missionary §YLamar§!, Tayyib and his loyalists were secretly sent to Yemen, a vassal of the Fatimids, where §YQueen Arwa§! of the §YSulayhid§! dynasty and Yemeni missionaries secretly raised the caliph. Subsequently, the Shiite community split again into the Hafiz and Tayyib factions, and Tayyib's followers, to protect the Imam's safety, declared a renewed period of occultation for the Imam.\n\nBut the Fatimid dynasty's fate was sealed.

Ghana and its vassals were forced to convert to Islam, and the empire gradually declined, with its rich northern provinces being assimilated by the Almoravids.\n\nHowever, the fierce attacks of the §YCrusaders§! eventually pushed the Almoravids into the abyss. The §YMoroccan Uprising§! of §Y1147§! plunged the Maghreb into chaos, and the subsequent surprise attack by §YEl Cid§! completely destroyed it.

Accompanying him were the §YKomnenos§! family, Greek nobles, and a large number of refugees. They wandered without any monarch willing to take them in. But as they sailed past Iberia towards Britain, a fierce storm disoriented the fleet. After a painful ordeal, the Greeks accidentally reached an unfamiliar land—the coast of West Africa.\n\nThe storm scattered the Greeks into two different fleets. Theodore led the largest fleet to land on the §YJolof§! coast. The locals were no match for the Roman fleet equipped with Greek fire, and he quickly established rule over the land, calling it §YElysium§!, meaning the beautiful new world. Meanwhile, the Komnenos brothers, Alexios, led another fleet to land in §YBenin§!, where the Yoruba tribes quickly submitted to them. Thus, a kingdom known as §YNew Macedonia§! was established in Benin.\n\nDuring New Macedonia's military expansion, an army broke away from the main force. Its leader claimed to be the last emperor of the §YDoukas§! dynasty, §YAlexios V§!, and led his troops to Lake Chad to declare himself emperor.

Meanwhile, his Hungarian brother incited the Bohemian nobles.

However, within the church, Jan Hus and the reformists advocating church reform gained the upper hand, and the council ultimately chose a moderate stance to engage with Jan Hus.

Thus, peace was restored.\n\n§MPresent§!\nHowever, the §YTaborites§!, composed of grassroots believers, were not satisfied.

However, the new king acted tyrannically, imposing heavy taxes and suppressing peasants and the Taborites, hoping to curb the Hussites' growing influence. But the king's brutal actions ignited public anger. In §Y1430§!, the king arrested a large group of Hussite believers, and radical followers took to the streets. Prague councilors were thrown out of the town hall windows by the angry mob, igniting the powder keg of the '§YHussite Wars§!'.\n\nThe aging King of Hungary had not abandoned his ambitions. With Sigismund's strong support, Wenceslaus V was defeated and sought aid from Europe to form a Crusade.

She found the king's commander, claiming to be guided by the Archangel Michael to save the land of God from the pollution of the misguided.\n\nHer unwavering determination and extraordinary demeanor left a deep impression on the king, and the Bishop of Prague attested to her piety and righteousness. In desperation, Wenceslaus V agreed to appoint her to lead the king's army. Ultimately, this maiden, blessed by God, did not disappoint the king's trust. She was invincible on the battlefield, slaying the Silesian Count who supported the rebels and defeating the Hussite army.

To end both crusades and warlordism, in §Y1250§! this warlord called §YMindaugas§! converted to Christianity and was crowned Lithuania's first king by the Pope. Outraged tribes rejected both his apostasy and hated centralization, electing a Samogitian chieftain as high duke instead. Mindaugas ultimately allied with the Livonian Order, crushed all opposition, and imposed royal authority throughout Lithuania.\n\n§MThe Present§!\nAfter catastrophic lows, Poles never abandoned hope. The Piast Duke of Masovia struck a deal with the Hanseatic League - military support in exchange for Prussian coasts. He defeated eastern Polish warlords, rebuilding a stable Polish state. Though still threatened by southern Cumans, an alliance with Lithuania finally consigned the Prussians to history's grave while securing Poland's safety.\n\nIn §Y1324§!, the fierce German Civil War offered Masovia hopes of reunification. Initially neutral, Poland joined the Emperor's side, but Lithuania was mired in war with Rus' while Masovia collapsed under Cuman invasion, forcing defection to North Germany.\n\nThe betrayal proved costly. North Germany lost the war, while Masovia forfeited southern lands, with §YKraków§! defecting to the Empire. Lithuania's invasion of Rus' met stubborn resistance, and relations with Livonia deteriorated. Cunning Cumans emerged strengthened from Carpathian crusades, learning from Christian wars. Clearly, the East's future remains forged in battle."

string_start_DD_persia: "§OThe Past§!\nOnce-magnificent Persia had already declined before the rise of the Mongols. After suffering ravages from all sides, few true Persians ever reunified §YEran Shahar§!. As expected, when the Mongols rose to power, the plateau welcomed new masters. The earlier sinicized Mongols brought with them technology, institutions, and culture from China, forcefully rewriting the destiny of this land.\n\n§YChagatai§!, also called §YLiu Huaisu§!, as the resolute and courageous second son bearing §YGenghis Khan's§! imperial falcon token, breached the gates and systematically destroyed all powers in the Persian region, his military reach extending to Mesopotamia. He strictly enforced Genghis Khan's laws, using military force to implement various cultural and educational reforms. Many rebelled in dissatisfaction, but were brutally suppressed by the Mongol armies - when §YBaghdad§! revolted against his rule, Chagatai personally led troops to suppress the rebellion, besieging the city and declaring '§YThose who can recite Mencius shall be spared§!', thus turning §YIraq§! crimson. His harsh and brutal governance led to repeated uprisings, yet the warrior spirits always favored Chagatai's armies. The nation he established was the Yuan Dynasty's §YZhao Princedom§!, or alternatively called by the more traditional Mongol term §YChagatai Ulus§!, its domain stretching from Anatolia to Afghanistan, from Transoxiana to Egypt - all surrounding lands trembled before its divine might.\n\nChagatai himself was rigid and ritualistic, responsible for law enforcement and judgments. The stern Chagatai was perfectly suited for this duty, being appointed Chief Justice in charge of the Yuan's legal affairs. Consequently, he often needed to travel to China for official business, leaving governance of his domain to his heir §YLiu Ben (Muatagan)§!.\n\nWhen the §YGreat Yuan§! experienced political turmoil, Chagatai was often the first to take up arms attempting to restore order, yet ultimately met with failure. After his death, Liu Ben ceased opposing the central government, exchanging submission for §YKublai Khan's§! official recognition and tributary relations. Liu Ben's temperament was more benevolent than his father's - during his rule, he constructed irrigation works, encouraged agriculture, relaxed the oppressive policy of 'spreading doctrine by the sword', and compromised with local powers, gradually stabilizing the turbulent Chagatai Ulus. Yet he was not merely known for benevolence - rebellious vassals were often crushed by his swift military campaigns, his strategic acumen even surpassing his administrative skills.\n\nHowever, Liu Ben's reign was not long. In the seventh year of his rule, he fell from his horse while drunk and died soon after from severe injuries. The designated successor §YLiu Nengkuan§! was still young, with power falling to influential minister §YWang Qiyang§! as regent. Wang Qiyang followed established policies without altering Liu Ben's decrees, diligently guiding the Chagatai Ulus through the transition to Liu Nengkuan's rule. After ruling for merely three years, Liu Nengkuan similarly died from an accident, having made little political impact. Wang Qiyang continued as regent for Liu Nengkuan's son Liu Bing. These rapid successions created instability, and despite Wang Qiyang's efforts, regional powers began growing beyond control.\n\nLater Chagatai rulers included capable individuals, but their reigns were often brief, with power unable to be solidly and effectively inherited and consolidated. This deepening regional autonomy eventually led to powerful local factions establishing independent rule.\n\nThe first to attempt secession were the Turkic tribes of §YAnatolia§!. Already loosely governed, these tribes grew increasingly restless until they raised the banner of rebellion, refusing to pay tribute. Yet their first revolt was crushed like a mantis trying to stop a chariot, as §YAzerbaijan§! and §YGeorgia§! commander §YChu Hun§! was ordered to suppress them, achieving seven victories in seven battles that forced the Turkic tribes to resubmit. Chu Hun, believing in showing mercy to defeated foes, disobeyed orders from the royal court by not punishing the Turkic tribes harshly. Instead, he appointed §YOsman§! as tax collector to govern Anatolia - though the first crisis of Chagatai's disintegration was extinguished while still a spark, Chu Hun's overreach further weakened central authority, as regional nobles began disregarding the court.\n\nAfter several precarious years, Chagatai's rule finally collapsed following a failed suppression of Afghan hill tribes, sparking widespread peasant revolts and military mutinies. In despair, the new Chagatai ruler §YLiu Shenyi§! sent several messengers to the Yuan central government pleading for aid, then locked himself in his residence, abandoning governance. Near the princely residence, two powerful clans - Azerbaijan's §YChu (Chobanid)§! family and Iraq's §YZha (Jalayirid)§! family - turned their territories into personal kingdoms, competing against each other while both hoping to become the dominant power... The Chu family was even granted the title §YDuke Yi§! by the Yuan court for quelling rebellions, while the Zha family controlled the wealthy Mesopotamian lands; §YMazandaran§! was ruled by the native Persian §YBaspanid§! dynasty, who occasionally used the Chinese surname '§YPan§!' to show submission, yet remained neutral as Chagatai teetered on collapse; §YKhuzestan's§! Ma clan claimed descent from an ancient Chinese prince who fled political persecution to Armenia, thus demanding more equal treatment; §YFars§! was governed by descendants of the devoted regent §YWang Qiyang§!, though his successors couldn't guarantee similar loyalty, offering only the minimal courtesy of not adding to the chaos; §YYazd's§! Liu clan, though sharing the royal surname, were actually descendants of the §YQutlugh-Khanids§!, using every crisis to expand their influence under pretense of supporting the throne; §YKerman's§! commander was the Yuan emperor's younger brother §YLiu Zongcheng§!, exiled after being accused of treason, who staunchly supported his relative Liu Shenyi despite being powerless to help; §YBalochistan's§! chieftains were inherently difficult to control, with tribal leaders now claiming descent from Tang Dynasty royalty to justify autonomy; §YSistan's§! ruler was a survivor of the §YSaffarid dynasty§! who maintained existence through constant compromise, remaining obedient to all powers; §YKhorasan's§! complex power structure had no single dominant faction, resulting in joint rule by Persian, Han Chinese and other ethnic warlords who constantly demanded privileges from the central government; §YHerat's§! garrison commander §YQin Zhixian§! openly killed the local governor and ruled through military force; §YAfghanistan's§! governor §YLu Yongwang§! carefully maintained balance between internal and external forces without showing ambition; while Transoxiana's governor §YZhang Xun§! and general §YSu Xianxing§! conspired together, privately styling themselves '§YKing of Transoxiana§!' in clear rebellion.\n\nAt this critical juncture, a great general marched from the Northern Protectorate, pacifying Transoxiana in just two months - Su Xianxing fell in battle while Zhang Xun fled to the Caspian Sea before hanging himself. This was the Yuan central government's dispatched savior - originally the Yuan's Left Cavalry Commander, a Barulas Mongol who had been granted the imperial surname §YWei§! and personal name §YHuo§! for his valor. When one of Liu Shenyi's messengers miraculously reached the capital, Emperor §YLiu Kecheng§! appointed Wei Huo as Supreme Commander of Western Frontier Affairs, leading 30,000 troops with full discretionary powers.\n\n§YWei Huo§! established his base in Transoxiana, dividing control of Khujand, Bukhara and other cities before marching south to swiftly crush Khorasan's local forces, appointing deputy commander §YGuo Lunjing§! as acting governor and garrison commander; his right flank commander §YZhang Ruyi§! besieged Herat, forcing Qin Zhixian to surrender. As Wei Huo's forces swept through Persia, various factions surrendered en masse, with Liu Shenyi hosting a grand banquet in his honor. Avoiding excessive bloodshed and aware of his tenuous foothold, Wei Huo punished only ringleaders while preserving most power structures, merely adjusting administration to foster mutual tensions. Meanwhile, Anatolia revolted as its Turkic tribes - unaware of Wei Huo's western campaign - believed Chagatai too embroiled in chaos to respond. Led by §YOsman§!, they killed local officials and declared independence again. Wei Huo turned west, defeating Osman three times in Georgia before capturing him near the Black Sea. Displayed in a cage before Chagatai's court as warning to other governors, Osman's clan suffered severe punishment - stripped of territories redistributed to other tribes, though remaining chief tax collectors.\n\nFor his pacification achievements, the Yuan government appointed Wei Huo §YChief Overseer of Transoxiana§!, headquartered in Transoxiana with authority over both military and civil affairs across Chagatai and Jochid territories. His deputy Guo Lunjing became Khorasan's governor, nominally serving Chagatai but primarily obeying the Chief Overseer. Thus Transoxiana became Wei Huo's base for supervising Chagatai affairs.\n\nYet like Chagatai's line, Wei Huo died unexpectedly after just a few years, succeeded by his grandson §YWei Ming§! as acting ruler. Without Wei Huo's iron grip, Chagatai's regions gradually resumed autonomous rule - while not openly rebelling as before, they showed no respect to the central government.\n\n§MThe Present§!\nAs time passed, even the Great Yuan eventually collapsed. The silver lining was that the new §YDaxu Dynasty§! had not yet extended its western expansion to the Yuan's western princedoms before becoming mired in internal troubles. The bad news was that Chagatai seemed destined to relive its past disintegration. Anatolia and Georgia existed in name only; Azerbaijan's §YChu Chongguang§! and Iraq's §YZha Weishu§! resumed their ancestors' rivalry to become chief power-brokers; Mazandaran's governor was the puppet §YYing Wenhua§!, deeply controlled by the Baspanids to form a state-within-state; Khuzestan's governor §YShan Jiyue§! was similarly manipulated by the Armenian Ma clan; Fars remained under the Wang family, with Chancellor §YWang Yichang§! balancing factions while pursuing self-interest; Yazd's governor Liu Zhi openly proclaimed descent from Liao Dynasty emperors, his ambition obvious to all; elderly Liu Zongcheng in Kerman repeatedly petitioned for retirement; Balochistan remained ungovernable, its desert chieftains rendering appointed governors powerless guests in Kerman; Sistan's Saffarids survived through their usual submission; Khorasan's veteran general §YGuo Lunjing§! struggled endlessly with local affairs; Herat's troops reinstalled §YQin Xiangxian§! (son of Qin Zhixian) as de facto ruler; Afghanistan's §YLu Yongwang§! maintained his careful balancing act, though his son §YLu Youde§! frequently overstepped boundaries; the new Chief Overseer §YWei Minne§! inherited his grandfather's ambitions but was bogged down suppressing heretic revolts; while the new Zhao Prince §YLiu Sihui§! controlled little beyond the capital, anxiously watching the impending collapse.\n\nRegardless, the coming storm is inevitable. Persia, with its glorious heritage that still radiates cultural influence, remains dormant - this land that once neared the center of world civilization now faces new trials."

string_start_DD_mongol:"§OThe Past§!\nThe Battle of Yehuling broke the backbone of the once-invincible Great Jin. The Emperor Genghis pursued the victory, thoroughly annihilating the powerful state founded by the Jurchens without hindrance. The Mongols, victorious too soon, found themselves unexpectedly ruling over vast lands and multitudes of people in China, as helpless as a drop of ink falling into a rushing torrent. But Temüjin had foreseen this possibility early on; from the initial stages, he absorbed substantial nourishment from the Central Plains. The Mandate Heaven's True Man from the northern deserts understood well that in such circumstances, there was no need to forcibly block or even struggle against the current; instead, he went with the flow. After securing complete control over the vast territories of the Great Jin, Temüjin resolved to adopt Han customs, utilizing the abundant resources of the Han lands to strengthen Mongolia. Countless Han Chinese military officers and Confucian scholars were enlisted, and many renowned Chinese luminaries became honored guests of Temüjin, advising him and discussing classics and doctrines. After assimilating a great deal of technology and knowledge from China, and integrating the Chinese bureaucratic and military systems into his Great Mongol State, he further advanced the process of Sinicization. Amidst his ministers' exhortations that '§YThe True Man of Heaven hails from the Northern Deserts§!', he ascended the throne, adopting the era name §YZhaowu§! (Illustrious Martial). The name of the state was taken from a line in the §YClassic of Changes§! (I Ching): '§YHow great is the Qian Yuan! All things derive their beginning from it, and it commands Heaven§!', thus establishing the §YGreat Yuan§!.\n\nSoon, §YTemüjin§! further adopted the Han surname §YLiu§!, with the Han personal name §YBinzhen§!. He established the Imperial Academy to educate the Mongol nobility in the Chinese language and various arts, and personally bestowed Han names upon his four sons: Prince of Jin, Jochi, became §YLiu Chuxing§!; Prince of Zhao, Chagatai, became §YLiu Huaisu§!; Prince of Qin, Ögedei, became §YLiu Shengcheng§!; Prince of Yan, Tolui, became §YLiu Mingjian§!. He established Branch Secretariats to administer various regions, appointed myriarchs to key military positions, compiled the 'Collected Statutes' (Da Huidian), and published 'Commentaries on the Classics' (Zhujing Zhu)... The Zhaowu Emperor had molded everything under his control into a colossal behemoth that still fit within the traditional Chinese framework yet was fiercely aggressive.\n\nSinicization did not halt the great conquests. The rationally managed resources allowed Temüjin to operate on an even grander scale. Within a few years, he eliminated the Western Xia, carved through the Western Regions, and stood firm as a great northern power. Jochi was dispatched northwestward. Leading his large army, he soon saw the Nine-Bunched White Standard flying over the Caucasus Mountains. The massive coalition of the Rus, lured deep into Mongol territory, were exhausted by the riverside and easily crushed by Jochi's forces. Many Rus nobles were slain, and the rest were forced to bow and swear allegiance. Jochi appointed numerous Han Chinese bureaucrats to administer the newly conquered lands, enfeoffed Han military officers to maintain military control in various areas, and also appointed many local chieftains as officials, ruling with a combination of firmness and flexibility. Chagatai was dispatched southwestward. Bearing the gerfalcon plaque bestowed by Temüjin, Chagatai forced his way through the passes, destroying the powers of the Persian region one by one, his military reach extending to the Two Rivers. He strictly enforced Temüjin's laws and decrees, forcibly implementing various cultural and educational policies through military might. Many rebelled due to dissatisfaction, only to be brutally suppressed by the Mongol armies - after a rebellion in Ray against his rule, Chagatai personally led troops to quell the revolt, besieged the city, and ordered that '§YThose who can recite the Mencius shall be spared§!'. Thus, the city was dyed crimson. His harsh rule led to repeated uprisings, yet the spirits of the Temple of the Martial Marquis always seemed to favor Chagatai's armies. In both major campaigns, Tolui, the most skilled in warfare, served as deputy commander. He was involved in nearly all of Mongolia's military expeditions, holding the title Grand Marshal. Ögedei, the most adept at statecraft, known for his gentle temperament and charisma, remained at the center, assisting in governing the state, overseeing all administrative affairs, and was appointed Chief Judge (Yeke Jarghuchi). Chagatai was responsible for the execution and adjudication of laws and decrees; his sternness made him perfectly suited for this role, and he was granted the title Master of Regulations. Jochi oversaw sacrifices and hunting; all manner of rituals were performed under his direction, and he served as the Chief Controller of the Court.\n\nBefore Temüjin's death, a formidable great dynasty already stretched across the land. He studied Confucianism and was revered by Confucian scholars as a Great Master. Due to the constant unrest among the various barbarian peoples, he ultimately revised the §Y'Lixue Juding'§! (Determined Settlements on the Study of Rites), establishing the official Yuan state doctrine of Ritual Studies, prioritizing territorial expansion and repelling barbarians. After completing this work, his ambitions continued to swell. Although he now resembled a Chinese Emperor, a Son of Heaven still remained in the south, which troubled his rest. Yet, as he plotted the conquest of the Great Song and the unification of all under Heaven, a severe illness left him bedridden for months. Upon his recovery, his ministers and empress urged him to designate an heir. He thus summoned his sons, close attendants, and key ministers to decide who would succeed to the Great Yuan's lineage. Chagatai, who had long been at odds with Jochi, bluntly stated, 'Jochi is a Merkit bastard, how can he be Emperor?'. Jochi argued with him, and although Temüjin ultimately stopped them, both lost their claim to succession. Temüjin had always favored Tolui, but he viewed Ögedei as the more suitable successor. He made them break arrows and swear that Ögedei would become Emperor, and that even if his descendants were mere lumps of rotten flesh, they would still be Emperors, and any who violated this oath would be attacked by all under Heaven. He particularly demanded that Tolui swear to wholeheartedly submit to Ögedei and assist him. After settling the succession, Temüjin once again began planning the unification of China, but before his plans were complete, he fell gravely ill once more. This time, he passed away. In his final moments of weakness, he gathered everyone again, leaving his final wish that all should exhaust their efforts to assist Ögedei and must conquer the Song Dynasty, not allowing a separate realm to be enfeoffed south of the Yangtze.\n\nÖgedei ascended the throne, adopting the era name §YTonghui§! (Unifying Assembly), and posthumously honored Temüjin as '§YThe Sagely Martial Emperor Who Modeled Heaven and Initiated Fortune§!', with the temple name Taizu. Upon his accession, he again initiated plans to conquer the south. However, frequent rebellions among the various barbarian peoples made it difficult for the Great Yuan to allocate sufficient manpower to the southern front, and progress was extremely slow. During these campaigns, Ögedei reformed various institutions, improving and optimizing many structures built upon Temüjin's foundations. He lightened corvée labor and taxes, encouraged agriculture and sericulture, leading to a gradual prosperity within the Great Yuan's domains. Yet, just as Ögedei had finally dealt with the troublesome affairs and decided to personally lead the armies south, he, who could have inherited and perfected his father's legacy, succumbed to excessive alcoholism and passed away.\n\nAlthough Ögedei died before conquering the Song, the Western Expedition led by his eldest son, Güyük, and the sons of other Mongol nobles achieved great victory. The Rus, already terrified, often surrendered without a fight. The Great Yuan's armies attacked the Magyars, causing Kelen to flee in panic, and Poland was also conquered. Güyük's Han name was §YLiu Chi§! (Liu, the Galloper), and his conquests were as swift as lightning. Upon receiving news of Ögedei's death, he raced back to the homeland, during which time Tolui had been serving as Regent for several years. Tolui welcomed Güyük into the court, offered him fine wine, and Güyük, suspecting nothing from his fourth uncle, drank the poisoned wine and died. Güyük's death threw the court and the country into turmoil. Tolui quickly led armies to suppress unrest everywhere, imprisoned Ögedei's other sons, and issued an edict informing his brothers that Güyük had died from alcoholism like his father, and that his sons were unfit to rule, thus assuming the regency once more. Jochi, who had long been close to his youngest brother, suspected nothing. Chagatai, however, was furious, believing Tolui had usurping intentions, and went to war against him. They fought in Transoxiana; Chagatai was decisively defeated and forced to acknowledge Tolui's regency, also losing control over Transoxiana and other territories.\n\nTolui administered the state and presided over the campaign against the Song, which progressed with unstoppable force. His eldest son, Möngke, had died early from plague. His second son, §YKublai§!, captured Jing and Xiang as easily as reaching into a bag, earning his deep affection. Not long after, Tolui also died from alcoholism. His son Kublai, due to his military achievements, was elected by his brothers to oversee the regency. Kublai's southern expedition advanced triumphantly, conquering the Song, Dali, Tibet, and then proceeding south to capture Jiaozhi, Myanmar, and other lands, and eastward to subjugate Goryeo. His military feats were illustrious. The ministers urged him, 'The state cannot be a single day without a ruler,' and thus Kublai ascended the throne as Emperor, adopting the era name §YZhongtong§! (Central Unity). He changed his Han name from Liu Pingzhang to §YLiu Shaoye§! (Liu, the Inheritor of Legacy). He posthumously honored Ögedei as the Emperor Yingwen (Illustrious and Cultured), temple name Taizong, and honored Tolui as the Emperor Jingxiang (Admirable and Laudable), temple name Ruizong. Japan and various Nanyang (Southeast Asian) states expressed submission and offered tribute.\n\nKublai continued reforms, adding laws and regulations, eliminating redundant offices, and restructuring military and administrative organizations, undertaking sweeping reforms in all areas that almost completely rejuvenated the Great Yuan. However, upon hearing the news, Chagatai rose in rebellion again, claiming to correct the wrong, but he accidentally fell into a river and drowned while crossing. His son, §YMö'etüken§!, had always been on good terms with Kublai, so he led his troops back and submitted to Kublai. Kublai reciprocated by restoring the lands of Transoxiana to the Chagatai line. Jochi had also died years earlier from old age and illness. His son, Batu, had long held grudges against Güyük, and there had always been tension between them, so he did not oppose the Toluid line's succession. Thus, Kublai ruled over an immensely vast Great Yuan. Not content with his current conquests, he soon appointed his brother §YHulagu§! to march towards India. Hulagu entered the Ganges Plain as if entering no-man's-land, quickly establishing new rule in Northern India. He then sent his brother Ariq Böke westward by sea to project power in Nanyang and India, even sailing as far as Arabia and East Africa, establishing maritime links between Northern India and Persia. Kublai was also honored as a Great Master. He further refined the official state doctrine, de-emphasizing expansion and strengthening legal and moral constraints, causing Confucianism to transform again, becoming more similar to the Cheng-Zhu School of Principle. Henceforth, acting more as a ruler than a conqueror, Kublai resolved to create a prosperous age, allowing the stern, murderous aura of Taizu's 'forest of blades' to become less overt and more restrained and implicit.\n\nAfter completing various conquests, the Mongols, under Kublai's leadership, finally quieted down temporarily. If Temüjin made the Great Yuan rise like the sun, Kublai made it shine brightly at its zenith. Although the great enterprise of conquest began to stagnate somewhat, Kublai's contribution to the era of peace and prosperity under the Great Yuan's rule was paramount.\n\n§MThe Present§!\nHowever, sunset is the way of nature. After roughly two hundred years of peaceful integration and prosperity, the Great Yuan ultimately fell into frequent chaos. The pillars of its rule crumbled. This aging great dynasty not only saw its connections with the various northwestern princely apanages nearly severed, but land annexation, exploitation by officials and nobles, and various natural disasters caused rebel armies to rise one after another. After years of stalemate, the Great Yuan withdrew grudgingly back to the Mobei (north of the Gobi Desert), returning to a more primitive state - yet the deep marks left by the long period of Sinicization remained engraved in their culture and customs, even intensified without diminishing."

string_start_DD_china: "§OThe Past§!\nThe divine fields of Yu were ravaged by war. In the late Yuan period, rebel armies everywhere established their own regimes. Four were the most powerful: §YLu Kerang§!, whom the people of Zhongli village had recommended as '§YSir Xu§!' for his philanthropy, marshaled his troops in Jianghuai. Through several military gambles, he miraculously managed to defeat the Prince of Wu, §YJi Zhiwei§!, who ruled over the wealthy lands of Zhe and Min, and now stood firm in the southeast, establishing his capital at Jiqing, renaming it Chengtian, harboring ambitions to pacify the realm; The Yuan Provincial Military Commander of Jinghu, §YLu Dun§!, controlled the area from Funiu to the Nanling Mountains. Even under the Yuan, he had managed his domain so tightly that 'not a needle could be inserted, nor a drop of water spilled'. Now, like Liu Biao of old, he held the central crossroads, incorporating Hong, Qian, and other areas under his banner, quietly awaiting Heaven's timing, with aspirations to seize the realm; In Heshuo, §YYang Youwei§! proclaimed himself Prince of Zhao. He captured Haidai to the south, controlled Daibei to the west, campaigned north against the former Yuan, connected with Liaodong to the east, succeeding in every endeavor, manifesting a momentum to cleanse the realm; In the northwest, §YXu Wenzhen§!, famed for his daring, once led a few dozen light cavalry to assault the main Yuan camp, charging back and forth as if entering No Man's Land, earning the nickname '§YPillar Reaching the Heavens§!'. His achievements overshadowed his lord, leading to friction, and he ultimately killed his former master, §YXu Changsheng§!, taking control of Hexi, Guanzhong, Heluo, and Hedong, intending to devour the realm.\n\nLu Kerang surveyed the Central States, believing he could not be secure without subduing Jinghu, so he chose to fight Lu Dun first. Although the military gamble initially met with great success - Xu forces broke through Lu Dun's defenses from three directions - the deeply entrenched Lu Dun quickly mobilized his armies to encircle and block the Xu forces, preventing them from expanding their gains, and attempted to surround and swallow the overextended Xu troops. Lu Kerang's foundation in Jiangnan was still unstable; after his military gamble failed to yield quick advantages, unrest stirred throughout Jiangnan, forcing him to withdraw and abandon the campaign. Contemporaries secretly circulated many writings mocking Lu Kerang. Many urged Lu Kerang to investigate and arrest strictly, but Lu Kerang believed, '§YIf we truly failed, do not anger because words speak truth; take it as fuel for determination.§!' Thus, he did not pursue the matter.\n\nAfter this defeat, Lu Kerang initially intended to refrain from further campaigns and focus on consolidating his rule. However, §YLiang Siwei§! and §YJiang Anhuai§!, entrenched in the Haizhou-Huai'an area with Yang Youwei's support, began harassing the borders. Many advised Lu Kerang to fortify his positions and clear the fields, believing the two would soon leave satisfied. Lu Kerang deeply agreed. Then, a man from Zhongli named Xu Li advised privately: '§YYou became Sir Xu because you brought peace to the villagers. Now, watching bandits cluster and cause chaos without acting is perhaps unrighteous.§!' Lu Kerang could not refute this. He could only pound the table and swear an oath, marshaling his armies north, vowing to exterminate the bandits Liang and Jiang.\n\nLu Kerang divided his army into two formations: one moved to Zhongli for patrols, commanded by §YXiao Lingxi§!, while the main force, led personally by Lu Kerang, headed straight for Haizhou and Huai'an, the base of Liang and Jiang. Yang Youwei, learning of Lu Kerang's expedition, secretly allied with Lu Dun for a joint attack, agreeing to cede all lands south of the Huai River to Lu Dun after defeating Lu Kerang. Lu Dun, still bearing a grudge from Lu Kerang's prior invasion, gladly agreed, but suspecting Yang Youwei had ulterior motives, sent small forces to attack Huizhou and Jianning separately as probes. Yang Youwei indeed did not march south, instead stationing his troops scattered around Haizhou and Huai'an, engaging only in passive harassment.\n\nLiang and Jiang naturally could not withstand Lu Kerang's military might. But Lu Kerang's campaign was also born of momentary passion, and soon great chaos erupted again in Jiangnan. With his army campaigning abroad, Lu Kerang could not return immediately. Popular uprisings and gentry rebellions erupted everywhere, even besieging Chengtian city. At this time, a minor branch of the Ji family, §YJi Hongsheng§!, led his clansmen in defending Chengtian, providing support to the Jiangnan forces loyal to Lu Kerang, quelling the great unrest. Learning of this, Lu Kerang reciprocated the favor. He did not persecute Ji Hongsheng for being a clansman of Ji Zhiwei and released many imprisoned Ji clansmen.\n\nSeeing that Liang and Jiang could no longer inflict losses on Lu Kerang, Yang Youwei immediately ordered his men in their cities to betray them, swallowing their territory before Lu Kerang could. Lu Kerang initially wished to avoid direct conflict with Yang Youwei, but Yang Youwei proactively led his armies south. Three large armies advanced along the Bian, Guo, and Ying rivers, aiming to crush Lu Kerang directly. Lu Kerang had to abandon his withdrawal, rushing around the Huai River to maintain his defenses. But his soldiers, long engaged in warfare, were exhausted and could only barely hold on. Simultaneously, Lu Dun, convinced that Lu Kerang was stretched thin, dispatched a large army down the Yangtze to attack Lu Kerang's rear. Lu Kerang could only order Xiao Lingxi to lead troops west for defense, straining his war against Yang Youwei further. Just as Lu Kerang despaired, Xu Wenzhen marched east, launching a surprise attack on Yang Youwei's rear. Though Yang Youwei was prepared, he was still caught off guard by Xu Wenzhen's elite troops. For a time, a stalemate ensued, with neither side able to gain the upper hand.\n\n§YThe Northern Yuan§!, still possessing some strength, saw the Central Plains in turmoil and sent a large army south, hoping to return to Dadu. Suddenly attacked on multiple fronts, Yang Youwei became the one who could not hold. Lu Kerang, rallying his spirit, joined forces with Xu Wenzhen, defeated Yang Youwei in several battles, drove him out of Jianghuai, and then focused south to fight Lu Dun, ordering Xiao Lingxi north for defense. Xu Wenzhen, having captured lands west of the Taihang Mountains, decided the Northern Yuan was less acceptable than Yang Youwei, so he made peace with Yang Youwei, proposing unity against the Northern Yuan. Yang Youwei refused, demanding Xu Wenzhen at least return Taiyuan, leading to a parting on bad terms. Finally, Yang Youwei and Xu Wenzhen fought a great battle at Ruzhou. Yang Youwei led his personal troops in a charge, engaging Xu Wenzhen in close combat, but was ultimately defeated and slain on the battlefield by Xu Wenzhen. Thus, the northern lands all fell to Xu Wenzhen, who alone campaigned north to resist the Yuan armies.\n\nMeanwhile, Lu Kerang fought several major battles with Lu Dun, ending in stalemate. Suddenly one day, Lu Dun vomited worms and died abruptly. Jinghu instantly disintegrated internally, with Lu Dun's sons fighting over the inheritance, allowing Lu Kerang to defeat them one by one. Now controlling Jianghuai, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Jinghu, and other areas, Lu Kerang temporarily rested and built up strength. A few years later, a flanking army moved south, and proclamations secured Nanhai, Jiaozhou, and other lands. Just as Lu Kerang planned to send Xiao Lingxi to conquer Bashu, Xiao Lingxi declined the assignment and, furthermore, expressed a wish to retire to the mountains and forests. Lu Kerang invited him three times to take office, but he refused. Xiao Lingxi had known Lu Kerang since childhood; his ancestral home was Liu'an, and his military merits were outstanding. Thus, Lu Kerang nominally enfeoffed him as Marquis of §YYing§! and permitted his retirement. Xiao Lingxi bowed in thanks and retired to the southeast. Lu Kerang had to personally lead the army into Shu. The eastern gateway to Shu, Kuizhou, had treacherous terrain and long resisted capture. Lu Kerang had men drag small boats over mountains to the rear, then descended the river, attacking Kuizhou from both inside and outside. The forces ruling Shu, hearing the Kuimen Pass had fallen, mostly surrendered without a fight.\n\nBy the time Xu Wenzhen carved his victory at Mount Yanran, China was almost divided between Lu in the south and Xu in the north. Both believed the next battle would decide it all, determining who would unify China. Xu Wenzhen struck first, attacking Nanyang and aiming straight for Xiangyang. Lu Kerang, in the eastern route, sent his navy north to harass the Central Plains, then gathered his forces towards Jianghan, preparing for the decisive battle against Xu Wenzhen. The two armies faced off at Xiangyang. Many strategists advised Lu Kerang to simply hold firm in Xiangyang, believing its fortifications would weary Xu Wenzhen's prolonged assault, causing his momentum to wane. But Lu Kerang decided on open battle. The two sides clashed. Xu Wenzhen repeatedly pierced the battle lines, twice firing arrows towards Lu Kerang, who remained steadfast and unafraid. Ultimately, Lu Kerang's solid right wing broke through the lines, enveloping Xu Wenzhen's army, crushing it decisively. Then, pressing the advantage, he campaigned north. Xu Wenzhen, severely defeated, lost his former sharpness. His defeat was like a landslide; he was driven to Youyan. The Northern Yuan sent an envoy to persuade him to submit to the Great Yuan, but he rebuked them: '§YI am a man of China! How could I be a subject of barbarians!§!' The envoy's face changed dramatically, and he left disgruntled. The war situation was dire and beyond recovery. Xu Wenzhen thus committed suicide by cutting his throat in his residence. Known for his righteousness, many of his ministers followed him in death.\n\nThereafter, Lu Kerang largely unified China. Although many regions still required military action, he deemed himself worthy of proclaiming himself Emperor and establishing the dynasty. The world often called him 'Sir Xu'; 'Xu' was an alternative name for his hometown Zhongli. Thus, Lu Kerang established the state name as '§YXu§!'. All regulations for ceremonial colors, retinues, and other institutions followed ancient models. An auspicious day was chosen for sacrifices to Heaven and Earth, and he ascended the throne as Emperor, era name §YTianzheng§! (Heavenly Rectification). Lu Kerang considered the Theory of the Five Virtues' Cycles ultimately inauspicious. By its logic, wouldn't every dynasty necessarily be overthrown to accord with the Five Virtues, meaning the Great Xu would eventually be replaced? Although theories of the Mandate returning existed, it ultimately could not provide stability. Thus, Lu Kerang did not match the state to a Virtue. He took the imperial name §YLu Jun§!, considering it the Water Virtue, established the rites, decreeing that future descendants upon accession should take a single-character imperial name based on the cycle of Five Phase generation, creating their own cycle of Virtues, no longer subject to overthrow.\n\nIn local governance, Lu Kerang discarded many Yuan institutions, planning a new set of administrative structures. Administratively, the central government established the §YGeneral Administration Office§! (Zongzhi Tai), handling local affairs, its head called the General Director (Zongjun); locally, §YBranch Administration Offices§! (Xingzhi Tai) were established, governing various circuits, their heads called §YDirector§! (Taijun). Militarily, local §YGarrisons§! (Junzhen) handled regional military affairs, establishing strictly regulated standing armies stationed everywhere. Like the former Yuan, army commanders were called §YArmy Commanders§! (Junzhang). Each circuit had a Commander-in-Chief (Tongjun) directing the circuit's armies, subordinate to the central Commander-in-Chief (Zongtong). Simultaneously, centrally directly-controlled organized armies were established, directly under the Commander-in-Chief. For surveillance and justice, Circuit Intendants (Xunshou) handled general affairs in various areas, subordinate to the central Minister of Justice (Sili). The three powers were separate, each managing its own authority. Central court discussions were divided into Inner and Outer Courts, consolidating and merging many Yuan institutions but also re-expanding and adding some functional officials. Finally, the 'Imperial Xu Statutes' (Huang Xu Zhu Zhang), 'Comprehensive Survey of Zhongxia' (Zhongxia Zonglan), and 'Great Comprehensive Canons' (Da Tongdian) were compiled as the general constitution of state affairs.\n\nAfter consolidating these, Lu Kerang considered the matter of designating an heir. He had long had a candidate in mind: his eldest son, §YLu Ding§!. Lu Kerang highly valued his eldest son. Before Lu Ding's birth, Lu Kerang dreamed by day of a spirit informing him he would gift the Lu family a celestial being of outstanding talent. Within days, his wife was pregnant and eventually gave birth to Lu Ding. At Lu Ding's birth, clouds suddenly blotted out the sun, winds thundered fiercely. Others considered this ominous, but Lu Kerang alone deemed it a dragon's sign, surely the celestial being gifted by the spirit. When Lu Ding grew slightly older, he indeed possessed a majestic bearing, intelligent and sharp. Lu Ding was usually lenient and harmonious, but when handling major affairs, he became solemn, balancing tension and relaxation adeptly. Many military and civil officials greatly admired this heir. Thus, Lu Kerang entrusted the Northern Expedition to Lu Ding, assigning him 180,000 troops combined land and naval forces, ordering him to recover Liaobei, a perfect opportunity to establish his merit.\n\nLu Ding's campaign in Liaodong proceeded smoothly. However, when marching north to the Huntong River area, he encountered great obstacles. The Northern Yuan military commander here was the Northern Yuan Prince of Dai, §YLiu Yunxian§!, who had recently been appointed in crisis as Commander-General of Haidong. The armies of Liaoyang, Goryeo, and other areas were now almost entirely under his command. He deduced that the Xu army's supply lines were strained from the long march, so he harassed the grain routes along the way and implemented a scorched earth policy, avoiding battle and holding firm. Indeed, Xu army supplies were hampered. Liu Yunxian then concentrated his forces and, leveraging better knowledge of the local terrain, constantly sought opportunities to attack the weaker flanks with superior numbers. Lu Ding did not wait passively. He immediately retreated to Liaodong, allocated part of his army to secure the grain routes, then judged that priority should be given to capturing Goryeo to prevent a pincer attack. He immediately crossed the Yalu River. Liu Yunxian was in Goryeo at the time, and a fierce battle ensued around Baozhou. The Xu army's vanguard was repulsed twice, but their strategic objective was achieved - Lu Ding had ordered ships to carry troops eastward; a large force descended the Han River straight to Hanyang. The local defender, Wei Yunchong, fled in panic to Ganghwa Island. Liu Yunxian, his forces stretched thin, had already committed most troops to the Baozhou-Pyongyang defense line and lacked a navy. Unable to withdraw forces from the fierce Yalu River offensive, he immediately abandoned Goryeo, leading his troops back to Longquan.\n\nLu Ding spent some time pacifying Goryeo, appointing a local named Yu Zonglue as Pacification Commissioner for Goryeo Civil and Military Affairs, temporarily acting in both capacities. He then prepared to continue the Northern Expedition. While crossing the Yalu River again, an old farmer told Lu Ding there were nine tripod cauldrons (Jiuding) in the river. Lu Ding laughed, considering it utterly baseless. A local scholar, Wang Chongming, hurriedly explained, saying this referred to the nine cauldrons cast by Emperor Huizong of Song, plundered by the Jin, and later, during Yuan-Jin conflicts, rumor had it the Jin threw them into the Yalu River to prevent the Yuan from obtaining them. Lu Ding thought if the cauldrons were truly in the river, the Yuan would likely have fished them out long ago. Their failure to be acquired by the Yuan Emperor over so many years meant either they weren't there or were extremely hard to find, not worth wasting time. Unexpectedly, soldiers rowing the crossing boats hit a hard object with their oars. Salvaging it, it turned out to be a large tripod cauldron. Accompanying staff observed it repeatedly and identified it as the Northern Cauldron made by Huizong. Lu Ding was overjoyed, considering it an auspicious sign enabling the conquest of the north. The accompanying physician, Jiang Chengjing, advised: '§YWhen Huizong sacrificed with this cauldron, water seeped into the ground. All officials deemed it inauspicious, only Huizong considered it auspicious. Later, he was captured by the Jin.§!' He argued that obtaining only one cauldron was incomplete, and its associated story was itself inauspicious; they should discard this unlucky cauldron. Hearing this, Lu Ding was displeased and reprimanded him: '§YThe Song lacked Youyan yet sacrificed to the Northern Cauldron; I have now broken Liao and Goryeo - how am I comparable to them?§!' He believed the Song used water from Xiongzhou as a substitute, thus incurring misfortune, while he had fought all the way to the Huntong River, making it naturally auspicious. Furthermore, discarding the Northern Cauldron symbolizing the northern lands now would be inauspicious, wouldn't it? Moreover, even a broken piece of jade was precious. Thus, Lu Ding did not heed the advice and carried the cauldron by his side. However, while crossing the Liao River, a sudden strong wind arose. The Northern Cauldron on Lu Ding's boat was improperly placed, making the vessel unstable. The boat capsized, and the cauldron fell precisely on Lu Ding, crushing him to death in the Liao River. The army fell into chaos. The Rear General, §YShi Qingyuan§!, temporarily assumed command, stationed in Liaodong, and sent messengers south with the tragic news.\n\nLu Jun, hearing of Lu Ding's death in Liaodong, was shocked, angered, and mourned bitterly all day. Coincidentally, exhausted from long labors, his old wounds from earlier battles flared up, and he contracted an epidemic illness, suddenly falling unconscious. Upon waking, his imperial countenance had drastically faded; he was so weak he couldn't even drink rice soup. He only summoned his second son, §YLu Ting§!, established him as Crown Prince, and ordered him to campaign all the way to the Heilongjiang (Black Water) River, before falling unconscious again. Lu Ting knelt by the bedside to receive the command and began his regency. After some time, Lu Jun gradually improved and summoned Lu Ting again, intending to give further instructions, but phlegm stuck in his throat, neither going up nor down, making speech difficult. Lu Ting knelt again by the bedside and said, '§YIf I die, I shall return the throne to my nephew.§!' Lu Jun nodded. Just as he wished to discuss further, he passed away suddenly.\n\nWith Lu Jun's dragon hidden and bow fallen (i.e., deceased), Lu Ting ascended the throne as Emperor, imperial name §YLu Kai§!, era name §YTianding§! (Heavenly Tripod). He immediately planned to restart the Northern Expedition, and within months personally led the campaign, the great standard pressing north. The army's advance northward was unstoppable. Lu Ting personally entered the fray, leading from the front, winning repeated victories. However, unforeseen storms arise. As the Great Xu forces reached the Heilongjiang River, a stray arrow in the chaotic battle struck Lu Ting in the ribs. Lu Ting endured the pain, pulled out the arrow, and shouted, '§YThe arrow hit my shoulder!§!' fighting courageously. Officers and soldiers thus pressed forward relentlessly. But after the battle, the wound festered severely, and army doctors were powerless. A palace attendant, Ban Mengchang, drew his sword to behead the doctors, but Lu Ting stopped him, saying, '§YThe doctors exhausted their abilities, attending my bedside day and night; Heaven witnesses their loyalty. The injury was truly caused by enemy weapons; how can we shift blame to the innocent?§!' Thus, he released the doctors. Soon after, Lu Ting passed away. Before his death, he was already delirious, only having time to decree the succession to his elder brother's son, §YLu Qike§!.\n\n§MThe Present§!\nThe Great Xu, newly founded with unstable foundations, experienced successive upheavals. Heroes across the land immediately rose together for the grand cause. They widely believed the Xu dynasty was not the legitimate power and sought to restart the war. Instantly, unrest stirred everywhere. Except for some regions still honoring the Nanjing court, most areas split off and declared independence. Even those nominally acknowledging the Great Xu court did so only in name.\n\nIn recently pacified Goryeo, Yu Zonglue intended to remain loyal to the Great Xu but was forcibly expelled by his subordinate §YLuo Zeyu§!. Luo Zeyu established a state on the spot, named §YGoryeo§! (Li). But not all obeyed him. Another warlord, §YWei Sizheng§!, raised troops against him in southern Goryeo, establishing the state of §YHan§!. The two were instantly at odds. Luo Zeyu, fierce and martial, sought to defeat Wei Sizheng quickly and then march west to establish a new dynasty. Wei Sizheng, possessing the demeanor of a scholar-general, planned to promote culture and education after establishing Goryeo, biding his time regarding hegemony; Shi Qingyuan, left behind in Liaodong, died of illness. His trusted general, §YLiu Huaihua§!, was recommended to temporarily replace him. Liu Huaihua ostensibly pledged allegiance to the south but secretly styled himself King, state name §YLiao§!. Under the banner of quelling rebels, he seized parts of Goryeo to strengthen himself, his ambitions swelling; The Hebei Army Commander, §YMeng Shangyan§!, rebelled, attacked and killed the Director Gao Weijun, and proclaimed himself Emperor of §YYan§!. Now holding troops in the north, he periodically campaigned north to raid Northern Yuan forces, accumulating high prestige in the borderlands; Popular uprisings erupted in Henan and Huaibei. One man, claiming descent from Guan Yu and seeking to clarify the world, led rebel armies spanning Haidai and the Central Plains. Leaders like Luo Yixin, Cao Rubing, etc., submitted to him. This was §YGuan Yanming§! from Laiyang, who ascended the throne as Emperor of the §YGreat Qi§!, now preparing to fight on both fronts; The Shanxi Director, §YFang Yanqing§!, relying on his silver tongue, rallied various forces, gaining unanimous support in Shanxi. He styled himself Duke of §YJin§!, merely preserving himself and the people of Shanxi, awaiting the right moment; In the northwest, the son of Xu Wenzhen's former subordinate Liang Shu, §YLiang Congli§!, also styled himself 'Pillar Reaching the Heavens'. Leading local militia, he entrenched himself in the Lanzhou-Ningxia area, calling himself King of §YZhou§!. Another of Xu Wenzhen's former subordinates, §YZhang Xun§!, emerged from Hehuang, using his old prestige to recruit followers, running rampant in Gansu. As Xu Wenzhen had once enfeoffed him as Marquis of Gan, he established the state of §YGreat Gan§! at Ganzhou. Another man, §YCheng Tongjing§!, gathered thirty thousand men in Guanzhong, marching armies across Qin, capturing cities as easily as reaching into a bag. Following his subordinate's suggestion, he assumed the title of §YHan§!. These three forces fought amongst themselves in the northwest, bloodying their eyes against the other two, each bearing mortal enmity, seeking the others' destruction; Shu rose in rebellion. The leader, Jiang Qing, honoring the Great Xu court, caused dissatisfaction among the masses. Eventually, the various factions split, each fighting independently. Jiang Qing was killed. Deng Chao, who reunified the factions, felt his abilities meager and yielded authority to the local notable §YLi Ling§!. Li Ling initially wished to submit to the Great Xu, but recalling Jiang Qing's fate, felt compelled to abandon the idea. Reluctantly, he proclaimed the state of §YShu§!, lightening corvée and taxes in Bashu, encouraging agriculture, seeking only to protect the borders and pacify the people; The powerful Dali noble §YLi Xiuchang§! in Dian, and the Miao region chieftain, Bozhou Tusi §YYang Tongheng§!, seeing the realm in chaos, allied with various local chieftains to fortify and protect themselves, harboring their own schemes; The Jinghu Army Commander, §YShi Dexiao§!, established the state of §YChu§!, aiming for hegemony. The Director Zhang Quan rallied remnant troops and defeated him in several battles, forcing him to flee south in panic, lying low. However, during the pursuit, Zhang Quan was ambushed and killed by the rebel Wang Shenyi. §YWang Shenyi§! then took the opportunity to invade northern Jinghu. A local scholar who had joined him advised that the place he now occupied was the very Tang state of the Zhou dynasty, and his ancestral home was also in Taiyuan, so he should adopt §YTang§! as his state name, which Wang Shenyi adopted; The Zhuang people in Guilin rose up one after another, taking the Director and Army Commander hostage, effectively forming an independent state; At the Zhe-Min border, Xiao Lingxi's son, §YXiao Su§!, seeing the years of major campaigns stripping the villagers to skin and bones, raised troops in righteous anger. He sent his wife to his hometown for safety, but his wife, §YSun Liuyang§!, also raised troops using her clan's influence in Shaozhou. They established their respective regimes in the two areas; Due to the chaotic situation, some fled elsewhere. One man, §YGu Xianping§!, led his fellow villagers to the island of Taiwan to take refuge.\n\nFor a time, heaven crumbled and earth split, beams collapsed and pillars fell. The vast Xu dynasty instantly became a bygone era. The remaining regions also armed themselves and attacked each other, either usurping rituals or wavering uncertainly. Though not completely severed from Xu rule, maintaining control over them became increasingly difficult. In the south, §YLin Huadong§! delivered tribute to the central court on time, even adding extra, but had already usurped the title of Prince of Min in Fujian and requested investiture from the court. The Inner Court councilors believed this precedent must not be set. Thus, the former Commander-in-Chief Yuan Shijing personally led an army to suppress him, aiming to revitalize court authority, but was shot and killed by Min soldiers with muskets en route. At this critical moment, §YJi Chuyuan§! took over as Commander-in-Chief as the great edifice tottered. First, he used a combination of coercion and persuasion to subdue the attacking Army Commanders §YXie Yuangan§! (Xuan Yang Jun) and §YHuang Si§! (Wei Ling Jun). Then, he recruited soldiers from his ancestral lands, forming the Changguo and Xianghua armies, appointing his confidants §YZhang Xingrun§! and §YZhang Pengqi§! as their Army Commanders, stationing them east and south respectively, first resolving the immediate threats to the court. Quickly, he also acted first and reported later, pacifying the rebel leaders §YXiao Su§! and §YSun Liuyang§! in Zhe-Min and Shaozhou, granting them nominal Director titles. The Jiangxi Branch Administration Office leader, §YLiu Wannian§!, proactively pledged loyalty. The southern Tiance Army Commander, §YZhu Biao§!, also pressured, reported for duty. Subsequently, Ji Chuyuan sent armies again against Lin Huadong, achieving several major victories before subduing him, ordering him to renounce his royal title but promising he could be called Marquis of Min. The Nanhai Branch Commander, §YZong Cheng§!, seeing this, immediately submitted and petitioned to be the vanguard. Ji Chuyuan refused the vanguard request, personally leading troops in two routes to attack Guilin. Victorious, he established a special Presidential Commissioner, appointing §YQin Shouren§! to the post, placing the area under military administration. The Jiaozhou Director, §YHu Wenji§!, surrendered upon hearing the news. §YShi Dexiao§! and §YWang Shenyi§!, seeing this, immediately renounced their imperial titles. §YLi Xiuchang§! and §YYang Tongheng§! also hurriedly sent envoys to the court. Thus, Ji Chuyuan turned the tide, enabling the Great Xu to temporarily hold on in a corner.\n\nAs the saying goes, a state cannot be a day without its ruler. Yet the Great Xu's turmoil lasted long, leaving it rulerless for an extended period. The matter of establishing an emperor was repeatedly postponed due to accidents. Now, with the state somewhat stabilized, discussions began on who should inherit the throne, mainly split into two factions: one believed §YLu Qike§!, son of Lu Ding, should be enthroned; the other believed §YLu Jianzheng§!, son of Lu Ting, should be. Beyond this, there were many other proposals, even including the Ministry of Rites Vice-Minister §YWu Yunpei§! suggesting that the meritorious Ji Chuyuan should inherit the throne. Ji Chuyuan, stating '§YThe late Emperor swore an oath beforehand; how can it be lightly changed!§!', overruled the objections and installed Lu Ding's son Lu Qike as Emperor, imperial name §YLu Bing§!, era name §YShenhua§! (Divine Transformation). Lu Qike was young and trusted Ji Chuyuan greatly. He enfeoffed Ji Chuyuan as §YGrand Marshal of All Forces Under Heaven§!, overseeing both military and civil affairs, also granting him the title Prince of §YWu§!, with Suzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Hangzhou, etc., as the Principality of Wu. He further bestowed two vermilion banners, one golden bell, one royal seal, and gave Ji Chuyuan the sword often worn by Taizu, encouraging him to serve the state. He also enfeoffed Ji Chuyuan's younger brother, §YJi Chuzhen§!, as Prince of Hui, sending him to his fief in Huizhou. Ji Chuyuan, administering the government and opening his own administrative office, commanded the regions still under Great Xu control.\n\nNow, the land of China is temporarily free from the scourge of war. However, the wind sweeping through the tower heralds a rising storm. Shi Dexiao and Wang Shenyi, seeing Ji Chuyuan busy with internal power struggles, reused the states of Chu and Tang, proclaiming themselves emperors again; The northern warlords wrestle with each other; And within the Great Xu, winds rise and clouds scud. With slight internal stability, factions engage in overt and covert strife.\n\nIn this still-warring China, everyone yearns for the sagely vision of '§YPacifying the millions within, campaigning against the disobedient without§!'. The masses raise their heads, hoping for a clear and peaceful world."

string_start_DD_japan: "§OThe Past§!\nOn April 8, 622 (the 22nd day of the 2nd month in the 30th year of Empress Suiko's reign), Prince §YUmaya§! (Shotoku Taishi), who held the reins of court government, passed away. After the death of Prince Shotoku, the power of the Soga clan finally reached its peak. None in the Five Provinces and Seven Circuits dared defy the will of the powerful Soga clan, and even the authority of the Emperor was often treated with contempt. On April 15, 628, Empress Suiko passed away, leaving the Chrysanthemum Throne without a designated successor. Although Prince Yamashiro no Oe, who had Soga blood, was wise and capable, §YSoga no Emishi§!, the Great Minister of the Soga clan, supporting Prince Tamura's ascension as Emperor Jomei to maintain the Soga clan's absolute position, thus excluded other powerful clans from the court and monopolized power arbitrarily.\n\nIn §Y643§!, §YSoga no Iruka§!, the son of Soga no Emishi who had been privately granted the Purple Cap, desired to install Prince Furuhito no Oe, who had Soga blood, as Emperor. Therefore, Prince Yamashiro no Oe, now the most favorable heir to the throne, became the greatest obstacle on his ambitious path. Ultimately, Iruka led troops to besiege the Ikaruga-no-miya where he resided, extinguishing the royal line of Prince Shotoku's descendants. §YNakatomi no Kamatari§! of the priestly clan, hearing of the Soga clan's atrocities and detesting Soga no Iruka's violent tyranny, plotted to assassinate him. He eventually drew close to Prince Naka no Oe and Prince Karu, and the three studied the Confucian teachings of the Duke of Zhou and Confucius together in a private school, discussing plans to overthrow the Soga clan on their journeys to and fro.\n\nIn §Y645§!, when envoys from the Three Han (Korea) came to pay tribute in Kyoto, Soga no Iruka also entered the court to attend upon the Emperor. Prince Naka no Oe, seeing the assassins hesitating and not daring to advance, angrily sprang into action, drawing his sword and stabbing Soga no Iruka. Struck in the thigh, Soga no Iruka, in shock and fury, drew his own sword and fought back, wounding Prince Naka no Oe before being hacked to pieces by the ensuing assassins. The Emperor subsequently withdrew into the inner palace. Nakatomi no Kamatari and Prince Karu quickly seized control of Kyoto and purged the Soga clan's influence.\n\nBut the Soga clan, having controlled the court for years, had influence like a giant tree blocking the sky. Prince Karu's father-in-law, §YSoga no Ishikawa Maro§!, who was supposed to support Nakatomi, switched sides at the critical moment, sending word to Soga no Emishi. On June 13, Emperor Jomei died of illness. The imperial forces could not withstand the great army of the Soga house and had to gather their troops, retreating with all members of the imperial family to the §YEastern Provinces§! (Togoku). In August, Soga no Emishi died of illness. The Soga clan was left leaderless, and Soga no Ishikawa Maro and the clan elders began a bloody struggle for power, forcing them to abandon their eastward advance. In 646, Prince Karu ascended the throne as Emperor in the Eastern Provinces, becoming Emperor §YKotoku§!. He appointed Nakatomi no Kamatari as Naidaijin (Inner Minister). Nakatomi no Kamatari rose steadily thereafter and was eventually granted the surname §YFujiwara§! by Emperor Tenji and awarded the rank of Daishokukan.\n\nAfter enduring continuous chaos and internal strife, the Soga clan in the Western Provinces gradually gained a firm foothold. Soga no Ishikawa Maro became the supreme ruler of the §YWestern Provinces§! (Saigoku). He implemented strict centralizing reforms and established absolute rule through a sophisticated bureaucratic system and a powerful private army. His grandson, the son borne by his daughter who was still in the womb at the time, inherited both the Soga name and the bloodline of Emperor Kotoku, becoming the foundation for the legitimacy of the later Soga rule. East of the Mino Barrier, the Japanese state under the Emperor gradually moved towards a different future. Kamatari's son, §YFuhito§!, was permitted to inherit his father's Fujiwara surname and established an imperial government led by the Fujiwara family, utterly loyal to the Emperor, uniting the other powerful clans and provincial shugo under the Chrysanthemum Throne. An aged warrior named Fujiwara Hidesato secured the high positions of Dajo Daijin (Chancellor) and Kampaku (Regent) amidst the turbulent political situation, henceforth unifying military and political authority and establishing a warrior-bureaucrat dual rule where he held supreme military command alone. Thereafter, the Kampaku concurrently held the positions of Dajo Daijin and Sei-i Taishogun (Barbarian-Subduing Great General). As the Minamoto and Taira clans submitted, the Northern Fujiwara house gradually split into the §YKamakura§! and §YEdo§! branches, later further dividing into the §YFuchū§!, §YShimosa§!, and §YKashima§! houses, collectively known as the Five Regent Houses (Gosekke), who controlled the high court positions and established a joint shogunate led by Fujiwara descendants, excluding demoted imperial family members and other warrior houses.\n\n§MThe Present§!\nIn the ongoing conflicts and campaigns between East and West, war and chaos fostered the rise of minor manorial lords and warriors, especially under Soga rule where private armies flourished. In the southern regions of Kyushu, where Soga authority struggled to extend, disgraced warriors, down-and-out merchants, and exiled ronin took root among the islands, establishing their own order through sword and coin. Initially, they were mere outlaws surviving in the gaps between the Soga and the Shogunate. However, as turmoil in the Central Plain dynasties severed tributary trade, the pirates soon discovered that true wealth came from controlling trade routes. They attacked merchant ships yet also struck deals with Korean and Chinese warlords and various Nanyang (Southeast Asian) states, exchanging for stronger weapons, faster warships, and greater ambitions.\n\nIn the distant Northern Land, beneath the dense forests and white snow of Hokkaido, lay the homeland of the Emishi. The Soga clan had repeatedly tried to conquer this land but were defeated by the silver-armored mountains, forced instead to grant official titles to tribal chieftains to secure their submission. After the opposition between the Five Regent Shogunate and the Soga clan arose, the Emishi gained more breathing space. Trade with the Central Plain brought ironware, silk, and civilization. Whispers spread on winter nights; the imperial armies had long since ceased treading the frozen plains, and the northern tribes began to discuss a future of their own."
