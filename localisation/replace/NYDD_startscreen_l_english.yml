Having lost much of its territory, it now survives amidst encirclement. The rulers of §YBadajoz§! care little for any authority; they are indifferent to nobility and honor. For them, the only right path is to seize the opportunity to eliminate the other Taifas, inherit the legacy of the Umayyads, and unify all of Al-Andalus. As for the Nasrids of §YGranada§!, they are passionate about the claim to the Caliphate, rallying and uniting fervent believers as their means to victory. Undoubtedly, they are deeply interested in the supreme position of Al-Andalus...\n\nAll of Iberia, all of Al-Andalus, now lies under a shadow. The war horn has been raised, waiting for the moment to sound its fury. The future of this region remains obscure. Perhaps the Christian kingdoms, experiencing a great revival, will once again unify Iberia; perhaps the Muslim Taifas, still holding onto hope, will have a chance to place Al-Andalus under the rule of Allah; or perhaps, both will become dust beneath the wheels of history..."

Outdated inheritance laws still plague this nascent nation like a festering wound. The Gonzalez family must use every means to escape this shadow, so they can once again lead the Christians in holding high the torch that illuminates the darkness. The region of Galicia is ruled by Carlos's brother, §YSancho§!, who together with Carlos rose to power. The hardships they endured along the way are too numerous to recount. Sancho does not covet the throne of Asturias but is instead obsessed with navigation. In Galicia, with its maritime traditions, he is like a fish in water, often leading naval expeditions himself, even attempting to cross the Strait of Gibraltar to pilgrimage to Jerusalem. His spirit of adventure is commendable, but Carlos's sons have long seen him as a potential enemy. If he cannot stay out of the fray, they will undoubtedly have to turn against each other.\n\n§YJimena of Navarre§! is eyeing everything. They once controlled most of Iberia, with many royal titles in their hands. But after the king's sudden death during the Iberian Union, they lost everything. The bloody civil war among the northern Christian kingdoms only ended a few years ago with the unification under the Gonzalez family. Now, the Jimena family is merely huddled in the mountains of Navarre, their eyes red with envy as they gaze at the lands of Asturias, their former rightful territory. They will stop at nothing, using any means, no matter how dirty, to reclaim it!\n\nThe §YPrince of Aragon§! has always been in this awkward position, caught between the influence of the French, the northern civil war, and the Muslim threat. Thanks to the protection of the empire, they seem detached from the conflicts of Iberia, but they face even greater troubles. The local council of §YValencia§! is effectively independent. Even if they choose to have an Aragonese prince rule, it would only be in name, with the more likely outcome being the election of a local noble. On the other hand, the empire and their French lapdogs have gradually lost patience. They see no sincerity from the Aragonese, having sent envoys multiple times hoping to make Aragon one of the many crowns. With all these challenges before them, where should Aragon go?"

Caliphate, the Taifa kingdoms have been in constant conflict, with no single ruler able to unify and dominate all of Al-Andalus with unchallenged authority.\n\nThe prolonged division marked the twilight of the Muslims, yet as the sun sets in the west, those in the east will greet the dawn.\n\n§YMallorca, Menorca, and Ibiza§! may just be three small islands that no one cares about. But for the local people, they are the endpoint of a lifetime of wandering.\n\n§YMenorca§! was an ideal escape. The Islamic §YKharijites§!, who adhered strictly to the true teachings of Islam, were unwelcome by the Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties, forcing them to wander. The last large group of survivors fled to the §YBalearic Islands§! during the Umayyad conquest and settled there, gradually forming a relatively prosperous community.\n\n§YMallorca§! was a vow to return home. The inhabitants of Mallorca came from distant §YEngland§!. During the great §YNorman Conquest§! and §YViking invasions§!, in the inevitable collapse, they fled, wandered, and declined the offer of the §YByzantine§! Empire (which promised them a territory in Crimea), eventually arriving at the large eastern island of Mallorca in chaotic Iberia. They defeated the local Muslim regime, driving them to the eastern island of Menorca, and began to call themselves New England.\n\n§YIbiza§! was a journey of necessity. These Vikings came from the §Y13th§! century Crusades, when the North Sea Empire had already converted to Christianity but still retained many Norse believers. These people followed the fleet to the Mediterranean, stunned by the wealth there. Simply put, they couldn't move on. Many Vikings deserted the fleet and began pillaging Iberia. Of course, this was all part of the North Sea Empire's plan to leave these '§Yprimitive barbarians§!' here. In any case, Ibiza gradually became a Viking pirate stronghold.\n\nThen, another grand invasion began. If the collapse of the §YUmayyads§! marked the first act of the §YTaifa Era§!, then the grand invasion of the §YAlmoravid§! Dynasty opened the second act of Iberian chaos. As if by fate, while El Cid led a surprise attack on Ceuta, the Almoravid Dynasty's hastily assembled fleet also embarked on a journey to surprise Valencia. However, this ragtag group of soldiers completely lost their way, arriving days later than expected. As they approached the coast of Valencia, the Christians on the shore were celebrating the great success of the surprise attack. Knowing that victory was hopeless, the captain ordered a retreat. But the crew, mostly slaves, refused, knowing that such a grave mistake would mean certain death upon return. So this lost Almoravid fleet turned towards the Balearics, intending to seize it as a haven and turn to piracy.\n\nAs land came into view, a joint fleet of Englishmen, Muslims, and Vikings unexpectedly blocked their path. After some friendly exchanges, mostly by the Kharijites preaching equality and brotherhood, the fleet agreed to join the island alliance, but only the Muslim group on Menorca.\n\n§MThe Present§!\nFor four hundred years, the inhabitants of New England have dreamed of returning home, the Muslims of Menorca have fantasized about an equal Ummah, and the Vikings have only cared about money. But the current situation is far from satisfactory. The alliance is good, but it is only an alliance. In this era, the Balearic Islands need someone to break the status quo and unify the islands. Only then can their story take a turn for the better."

string_start_DD_north_africa: "§OThe Past§!\nThe Crusader Kingdoms of North Africa originated from the adventurous Norman lords, Count Roger I of Sicily and his talented son's victorious expedition to Ifriqiya. The Muslims of North Africa were crushed by the Crusader armies, and the Kingdom of Africa stood tall on the lands of the Berbers. The fragmented remnants of Ifriqiya were forced to retreat deep into the Sahara Desert, surviving through tribal guerrilla warfare and sporadic aid from Egypt.\n\nIn the west, the Mauritanian Crusader Kingdom came from the legendary Iberian knight Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, the epic hero El Cid. He was tasked with crossing the sea to cut off the retreat of the Almoravid Dynasty and launch an attack on their homeland, where he remained stationed. The Almoravids, defeated by the Iberian Taifas and the Reconquista states, eventually crumbled, and the surviving tribes retreated into the sands of the Western Sahara. Over generations, Mauritania developed into an independent Crusader Kingdom, ruling over the lands of Morocco.\n\nThe two Crusader Kingdoms of North Africa formed a holy alliance, attacking the remaining Muslim forces from both east and west, ultimately bringing all of North Africa under the glory of the Holy Father. After the extinction of the Hauteville family in Sicily, the throne of the Kingdom of Sicily was seized by the Hohenstaufen heirs, while the throne of Africa was inherited by the descendants of El Cid, who had intermarried with the royal family for generations. The Norman branch of the family continued to hold the position of Grand Master of Cyrenaica, serving the kingdom loyally.\n\n§MThe Present§!\nAfrica was once a prosperous Catholic nation. Under the cold-blooded rule of Rodrigo III, he implemented a strong centralized monarchy, forcing the Moors under his rule to either convert or face death. The power of the kingdom was concentrated in the hands of the king, whose will was unquestionable.\n\nUnfortunately, his successor, the Mad King Diego, plunged the kingdom into chaos. In his early years, he indulged in pleasure and ignored governance, living a reckless and promiscuous life. In his later years, he struggled with madness and hysteria. The capricious king rarely attended to state affairs. During his long reign, the kingdom sank into corruption and decline. Despite the Cyrenaican legions guarding the borders, the Sultan of Egypt and the Crusader brethren in the Holy Land never ceased their covetous gaze upon Africa.\n\nUnder the long Christian rule, Muslim lords never extinguished the torch of rebellion. Several years ago, the Great Muslim Uprising won freedom for the devout Muslims of Morocco. The governor of Mauritania is still struggling to hold on, but the fragile Crusader rule seems to be cracking. The Cyrenaican legions can no longer tolerate the kingdom's chaos, and the tribes in the desert seem to see the smoke on the horizon, signaling the call for a counterattack."

string_start_DD_iberian_ARA: "§OThe Past§!\nWhen the flames of the Albigensian Crusade consumed the fields of southern France, the bronze doors of the Aragonese court echoed with the urgent knocks of exiled nobles. Pedro II, the Protector, knew he could not directly confront the combined forces of the Holy Roman Emperor and the Pope, so he turned a 'Protection Edict' into a shield, sheltering the persecuted heretics and nobles under his wing. The exiles brought not only gold and swords but also the wisdom of the Provençals, forging Iberian blades—Aragon's banners were planted on the walls of Valencia, pointing towards the struggling Taifas in the south.\n\nHowever, no pure roses bloomed in the thorny thicket of protection. The schism between Cathar believers and Catholic knights spread across the countryside, and Latin conspiracies clung to the court's pillars like poisonous vines. When Pedro II attempted to revoke the 'Protection Edict' to mend the divide, the powder keg he ignited finally exploded—in 1213, during the bells of St. John's Day, the steps of Barcelona Cathedral were stained with the king's blood. The five-year-old James I cowered in the shadow of the throne, witnessing the rebel banners of Valencia tear through the southern frontier. Ultimately, the peninsula's nobles quelled the chaos with an iron fist, but the crown of the new king was already entwined with the chains of the Latin faction, forcing Aragon to stumble forward in a quagmire of compromise.\n\n§MThe Present§!\nThe leader of the peninsula faction, Fernando II the Pious, now holds the scepter of balance. He soothes the temporarily pacified Latin faction with honeyed words while using the sword to quell the ambitions of the disloyal, bringing a brief return of peace and glory to the kingdom. But the cold winds of the Pyrenees never cease—the lion of Asturias covets Aragon's crown, and the lilies of the French princes seek to extend their roots into the cracks of Catalonia. Deeper shadows loom from the south and the sea—the Muslim Taifas and North African pirates weave their sails across the western Mediterranean, as if reminding this monarch: If Aragon cannot become the player of Iberia, it will ultimately become a pawn on someone else's chessboard."

string_start_DD_crusder_state: "§OThe Past§!\nThe great victory of the Crusades opened a bright future for Christians yearning for the Holy Land. After the disastrous defeat at Manzikert, the helpless Alexios I had no choice but to seek help from his Catholic brethren. The arriving Crusaders successfully took advantage of the chaos following the death of Malik Shah I, capturing Edessa and Antioch. The dying Fatimid Dynasty in the south was powerless to stop the formidable Frankish armies, while the chaotic Seljuk Empire was too preoccupied with Anatolia to intervene. Thus, four Crusader states—the County of Edessa, the County of Tripoli, the Principality of Antioch, and the Kingdom of Jerusalem—were established on the ruins of Muslim rule.\n\nBut the good times did not last. The famous Saladin rose from Egypt, overthrowing the incompetent Fatimids and launching a fierce counterattack against the Crusaders. Under the reckless command of Gerard de Ridefort, the Grand Master of the Templars, Saladin nearly annihilated the Crusaders at the Battle of Hattin. The County of Edessa was destroyed, the northern Crusader states were pushed back, and Muslims even briefly occupied Jerusalem.\n\nMeanwhile, a new Crusade appeared on the horizon. King Philip II of France and Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I successfully reached the Holy Land, and the united Crusaders managed to save the beleaguered kingdom, though reclaiming all lost territories remained a daunting task. They successfully captured Cyprus, which had rebelled against Byzantium, and once again expanded the kingdom's borders along the Palestinian coast. After Saladin's death, his descendants fought fiercely over his Near Eastern inheritance, and the Crusaders seized the opportunity to capture Egypt.\n\nHowever, the isolated Crusaders were eventually defeated by the Ayyubid successors, losing Egypt once again. In 1228, Frederick II, the grandson of Barbarossa and heir to the Kingdom of Jerusalem, arrived in the Holy Land. With the Pope's strong support, the emperor ended the chaotic succession disputes in Jerusalem and took on the glory of protecting the Holy Sepulchre. He allied with Sultan al-Kamil of Egypt, successfully defeating his eastern brother and capturing Damascus, ultimately ending the long-standing religious wars in the Holy Land through a controversial marriage alliance.\n\nAfter this astonishing peace, Sultan al-Kamil stabilized Egypt's politics, firmly establishing Ayyubid rule and consolidating military and political power in his hands. The Hohenstaufen heirs led the Crusaders in further campaigns, defeating the Turks and capturing southern Anatolia. After al-Kamil's death, his successors maintained a long peace with the Crusaders until the Syrian governor, allied with the Bedouins, launched a rebellion. The Egyptian Sultan, preoccupied with a succession crisis, could only watch as Jerusalem occupied his lands under the pretext of quelling the rebellion. Meanwhile, the Syrian ruler, though raising the banner of Jihad, could only retain a small portion of his territory.\n\n§MThe Present§!\nToday, the Ayyubid heirs in the Sahara Desert eye the Crusaders in the Holy Land, hoping to restore their ancestors' glory. The small kingdom of Jerusalem is once again shrouded in the shadow of succession disputes, as a young queen's rule fails to quell the ambitions of power-hungry factions. Arab Muslims and northern Crusader states alike vie for their share of the land."

string_start_DD_france_kingdom: "§OThe Past§!\nThe Norman Conquest was undoubtedly the most glorious victory in French history and the pinnacle of this once-pitiful kingdom. William the Conqueror, the first Norman Duke of England, secured the rich lands of Britain, which became a source of pride for the French Kingdom. However, the stubborn resistance of the English and the ever-watchful Norse raiders forced the kingdom to halt its expansion across the channel and instead focus on consolidating its existing territories.\n\nDuring the subsequent Crusades, the kingdom served as the sword of God. This prosperous nation seemed destined to dedicate everything to the Holy Father's cause. Enthusiastic crowds filled the streets, noble lords rode off to distant lands, and the mission to liberate the Holy Land became an urgent calling. Under the leadership of Louis, son of Philip I, the Crusaders vowed to expel the Saracens from the Holy Sepulchre, with the mighty and sacred France leading the charge. Under the Capetian dynasty, adorned with fleurs-de-lis, France's glory seemed to reign supreme over the two seas and the vast lands of Europe.\n\nUnfortunately, God had other plans. France's wars were not as smooth as those of its Christian brethren. Prolonged conflicts, exorbitant ransoms, and discord among the nobility led to the kingdom's gradual decline. Louis VI, returning from the Holy Land, struggled to control the nobility, and the Cathar heresy in the south sang the dirge of its demise. The Holy Roman Empire and the emperor's retinue assembled a so-called Crusade, invading French lands, while the southern nobles resolved to resist this aggression, dragging Philip II's France into the fray.\n\nWhen the dust settled, blood and bones filled France's trenches, and the southern lands no longer belonged to this once-mighty kingdom. Louis IX of the Capetian dynasty and John the Incompetent, the Angevin Duke of England who inherited the Norman legacy, died in the bloody battles of Poitou. The ancient Capetian dynasty was deposed by the emperor, and a new French Kingdom was carved from the corpse of the old, ruled by the Hohenstaufen emperor over the southern subjects. In the midst of this collapse, the young Henry III of England took up the sacred crown, struggling to hold together a kingdom in ruins, hoping for its eventual rebirth. However, the rebellion of English outlaws forced Henry III to sign the Magna Carta, relinquishing power in England.\n\nAfter the disaster, the Angevin kings cautiously attempted to rebuild the kingdom, slowly strengthening the central authority in Paris. They nearly succeeded, were it not for the terrible succession war. Edward the Black Prince, son of Edward III, died young during his father's dispute with imperial princes over the Low Countries. The young Richard II was placed under the regency of his uncle, John of Valois. In the ensuing power struggle, the king imprisoned the regent and confiscated his estates, but John's son, Henry of Valois, escaped and seized control of Paris while Richard was campaigning in Brittany, reigniting the flames of civil war.\n\nHelpless, Richard II had to turn to the nobles his predecessors had long suppressed. After a protracted civil war, Richard II finally secured his throne, but at the cost of once again decentralizing power to the nobility. Henry, who had reached an agreement with the king, also received a dignified outcome, though he had to cede his title to his brother, his family remained prosperous.\n\n§MThe Present§!\nDespite the ongoing turmoil in the north and the nobles' independent actions, the King of France will not submit to such a fate. A true French Kingdom must rise from past humiliations, and neither English remnants, Norse raiders, nor the empire's detestable schemers can hinder France's greatness. The absurd alliance of the Low Countries and England looms in the north, awaiting France's reclaiming of its glory.\n\nIn the southern kingdom under imperial rule, it is effectively a 'Free' Kingdom jointly governed by the Dukes of Gascony, Burgundy, and Provence. Though nominally subject to the emperor, southern politics are dictated by the three dukes. Burgundy and Provence share a common heritage from the Kingdom of Arles, while the Duke of Gascony has long been the uncrowned king of the south. For centuries, the three dukes have fought among themselves while outwardly submitting to the emperor's authority. Behind the dark curtain, the three dukes are staging a drama of intrigue and betrayal.\n\nAs the emperor's power wanes, the loosening chains in the south have led the dukes to set their sights further afield. Undoubtedly, France needs consolidation, but who will be the victor on the throne? Cooperation or competition, loyalty or betrayal—will they vie for the Roman crown or step back to pursue France's more enduring glory?"

string_start_DD_north_sea_empire: "§OThe Past§!\nScandinavia, the land of the Vikings, once saw King Cnut the Great attempt to establish a unified North Sea Empire, but it dissolved after his death.\n\nAs a descendant of Harald Bluetooth, King Harald III of Norway demonstrated bravery rivaling his ancestors. After returning from the Byzantine Empire and seizing the throne, Norway began to flourish. He invaded Denmark in 1062, capturing the Danish throne, and in 1066, he accepted William the Conqueror's proposal to jointly invade England. Harald the Great led Viking elites across the seas, overcoming logistical challenges and the disadvantages of fighting on foreign soil. Along the way, commoners welcomed them, nobles placed their bets, and Scotland and Northumbria joined the mighty Viking army. Fortunately, the weather favored them, and William's forces landed successfully in England, facing little resistance from Harold's English army. Hearing of Harald's approach to London, Harold hastily marched north to confront him, culminating in the Battle of Stamford Bridge. The English army initially used archers, but their arrows were blocked by Viking shields. Harald himself, protected by the Varangian Guard, charged into the enemy ranks. The English army was routed, and Harold's body was later found in a nearby ditch.\n\nHarald honored his agreement with William, possibly due to the efforts of the French king and the Pope, and the two decided to maintain their occupied lands, dividing England between them. Harald returned triumphant, his prestige at its peak, and he declared the reestablishment of the North Sea Empire, much like Cnut the Great had done. In 1071, he invaded Sweden, reaching Finland. Thanks to his brother Olaf's fervent promotion of Christianity, many Norse believers fled to Sweden and Finland, and Harald's invasion alienated the Swedes, who refused to convert and clung to their faith in Odin.\n\nIn 1075, the greatest Viking, the last Viking, Harald the Ruthless, passed away peacefully in Oslo. He ushered in a new Viking era, a new power—the North Sea Empire.\n\nBut the empire's glory was short-lived. Over the following decades, the lack of internal and external conflicts led to the army's corruption—recruit quality declined, upper officers became monopolized by the nobility, and ambitious young officers faced suppression and persecution. By the time Olaf III took power, the famous 'Rebellion of Rebekah' made him distrust the army, leading to massive cuts in the standing army and misallocation of military funds. Mercenaries, loyal only to wealth and not to the crown, became the empire's most relied-upon hounds, while the remaining imperial guard was heavily distrusted and suppressed. Beneath the vast empire lay conflicts between Christians and Norse believers, prolonged ethnic strife and division among Norway, Denmark, and Sweden, and the high autonomy of the Danish-controlled territories overseas...\n\n§MThe Present§!\nSweden, Finland, and Novgorod have long been deeply rooted in Odin's faith, breaking away from the North Sea Empire. The empire now consists only of Norway, Denmark, and the Danish-controlled territories, but even these are unstable: the governor of the Danish territories has not reported for months, clearly harboring rebellious intentions; the Swedes covet their former lands, determined to reclaim them; due to the German wars, the Hanseatic League disbanded, and the alliance between Denmark and Norway is gradually becoming competitive; the Angevin kings of France are also attempting to reclaim their ancestral claims and unify England; perhaps only the English remnants—the Five Provinces Alliance—are still happily making money.\n\nHowever, the current king, Olaf III Harald, struggles to govern such a vast empire. He is enamored with the art of the court, turning a deaf ear to the rebellions outside.\n\nThe North Sea Empire is like a ship on the verge of collapse, sailing through turbulent waters..."

string_start_DD_south_german2: "§OThe Past§!\n§YHenry the Lion of Welf§! was once a strong contender for the imperial throne who had the potential to crush the Hohenstaufen hegemony, but his rebellion was ultimately defeated by Emperor §YConrad III§!, and he permanently lost his Duchy of Bavaria, which was transferred to the Babenberg family. In 1180, Bavaria was again transferred by Frederick I to §YOtto I§! of the §YWittelsbach§! family, who had rendered outstanding service to the emperor during the Crusades, as compensation for the Babenberg family's elevation of Styria to the Duchy of Austria. In the early 13th century, through a marriage alliance with Henry V, Bavaria gained the title of §YCount Palatine of the Rhine§!, forming the Palatine branch of the Wittelsbach family. Around the same time, the §YAlbigensian Crusade§! forced France to submit to the Empire, and the southern French territories ruled in the emperor's name marked the Hohenstaufen family's rise to its peak. In the distant East, the charismatic §YFrederick II§!, grandson of Barbarossa, defied opposition and preserved the Crusader cause through a marriage alliance with Egypt's §YAl-Kamil§!, becoming a hero of Christendom and forcing even the Pope to compromise with him.\n\nIn §Y1236§!, §YFrederick II§! of the Babenberg family was expelled from Austria by the emperor due to his harsh management of family members and territories, as well as his strained relationship with the emperor, and he eventually died in the Holy Land. The Wittelsbach family inherited Austria, which had no heir, but in doing so, they were forced to sign the §YTreaty of Munich§! with the emperor, stipulating that the Wittelsbachs could never merge Bavaria and Austria. In §Y1254§!, Emperor §YConrad IV§! once again invaded the §YLombard League§!. Although the Pope's attitude toward the emperor was ambiguous, it still provoked strong resistance from the Italian princes. In §Y1268§!, Conrad IV died of fever, and his son Conradin faced the first disaster that shook the Hohenstaufen dynasty—the §YGreat Imperial Rebellion§!.\n\nDespite Conradin's pious demeanor, his widespread popularity, and his grandfather's significant contributions to the Holy Land and the Crusades, the Papacy could not excommunicate him. However, the Holy See unequivocally supported the rebellion against the emperor. The rebels, eyeing the imperial throne, joined forces with the Lombard League to launch a rebellion that swept across the Empire. In the end, Conradin had to seek support from other princes and compromise with the Papacy. The resulting §YTreaty of Rome§! stipulated that the emperor would relinquish interference in Italy, while the Papacy would hold absolute and supreme theological independence, with even the emperor barred from interfering in theological and sacramental matters. To secure the princes' support, Conradin reluctantly signed the §YGolden Bull§!, which enshrined the sacred rights of the princes and the Church, granting §YBohemia§!, §YBrandenburg§!, §Ythe Palatinate§!, §YSaxony§!, and the §YThree Archbishoprics§! the power to elect the emperor.\n\nRegardless, the Hohenstaufen family ultimately survived this crisis, though the Empire's future remained precarious. With the emperor's threat removed, the Lombard League gradually disintegrated, while the northern princes rose to prominence in the wake of the §YWendish Crusade§!. After the extinction of the Ascanian line, the Hohenzollern family of Ansbach inherited the Margraviate of Brandenburg. Following the Great Imperial Rebellion, the emperor temporarily lost control over the Empire's frontiers, and the §YHanseatic League§! gradually dominated northern trade, with North Germany rising from the Empire's ruins.\n\nFinally, in §Y1324§!, the ambitious northern princes once again set their sights on the imperial throne. A North German alliance led by the §YMargrave of Brandenburg§!, the §YDuke of Saxony§!, and the §YHanseatic League§! was formed, and the calamity known as the §YGerman Civil War§! struck the Empire once more, ultimately without a clear victor. In the aftermath, the Count Palatine of the Wittelsbach family was stripped of his title for participating in the rebellion, and it was transferred to the emperor's loyalists, the §YHabsburg§! family. Bavaria also gradually lost its influence over southern Tyrol. North Germany was forced to secede from the Empire, and the electoral titles of Brandenburg and Saxony were granted to §YBavaria§! and the §YLombard League§!, who had supported the emperor.\n\nIn §Y1335§!, the last male heir of Tyrol, §YHenry VI of Carinthia§!, passed away, and his daughter, the Countess of Tyrol, married into the Hohenzollern family of Ansbach. Eventually, the Tyrolean branch of this family fully controlled the §YCounty of Tyrol§! amidst the chaos of the Alps.\n\n§MThe Present§!\nToday, the Hohenstaufen influence continues to decline, and the South German princes, once loyal or indifferent, are once again turning their gaze toward the imperial throne. This crown, which seemed eternally destined for the Hohenstaufen eagle, is now surrounded by endless rebels and rival emperors. Although the Hohenstaufen heir ultimately retained the throne through the dynasty's formidable strength, the emperor's authority over the Empire is no longer what it once was.\n\nThe princes of southern France can no longer tolerate the rule of a German emperor, the Italian states will not miss this rare opportunity, the wealthy Low Countries remain ambiguous and indifferent toward the Empire, and even the Hohenstaufen branch in the Holy Land no longer wishes to deal with their Swabian relatives. Even Bohemia, the only truly neutral and peaceful realm, has sown the seeds of chaos with the Hussite and Taborite rebellions. Fortunately, the political marriage between Emperor §YFrederick III§! and Bavaria's §YBarbara II§! continues to maintain the alliance between Swabia and Bavaria. But the Hohenstaufen Empire is ablaze on all sides. Can Emperor §YFrederick III§! replicate the miracle of §YFrederick II§!, or will the family's glory and legacy crumble?"

However, after the death of the Grand Vizier §YNizam al-Mulk§!, the Nizari sect from Alamut Castle, led by §YHassan-i Sabbah§!, repeatedly assassinated key figures of the empire, greatly exacerbating the already severe succession crisis. The §YSultanate of Rum§! declared independence in Anatolia. The increasingly declining Seljuk Sultan could no longer hold back the Mongol onslaught. Finally, the Seljuks, holed up in Erzurum, chose to §Ysubmit§! to the Mongols, becoming vassals under the Great Khan and serving as his tax collectors in Anatolia.\n\nTo the west of Anatolia, the Sultan of Rum also lived in fear under the shadow of the Mongols. The §YCrusaders§! from across the strait decisively defeated the remnants of the Roman Empire, landed on the mainland, and marched eastward. Caught between the Mongols and the Frankish armies, the Sultanate of Rum inevitably fell into disarray. The Sultan and the coastal Turkic nobles chose to bow to the Crusaders, convert to §YCatholicism§!, and pledge allegiance to their new ruler in New Rome. From then on, the descendants of the Seljuks completely lost control of the inland regions, and Anatolia became a fragmented land.\n\nBut even the Crusaders could not withstand the Mongol advance. After conquering Persia, the Mongols continued their march toward Aleppo and Arabia. The Crusader coalition struggled to achieve victory on the battlefield, but the chaotic internal affairs of the Mongols gave them a brief respite. Ultimately, the §YKingdom of Jerusalem§! ruled Syria and the south in the name of the Mongol Empire, paying tribute to the Great Khan. The chaos wrought by war created a rare opportunity for Anatolia, and a small tribe named §YOsman§! emerged onto the historical stage.\n\nThe Osman tribe had long fought as mercenaries for both Turks and Greeks. During the invasion of §YCroatia§! against §YBulgaria§!, §YOrhan I§! of the Osman tribe took advantage of the chaos to seize §YGallipoli§!. Over time, the Ottomans gradually absorbed the remnants of the Sultanate of Rum and expanded eastward, subduing both the Seljuks and the Rum, nearly unifying Anatolia.\n\n§MThe Present§!\nUnfortunately, the Ottomans were not the only ones to rise amidst the chaos. A lame, Turkicized Mongol warlord named §YTimur§! emerged from Transoxiana. He and his army conquered Persia and Khorasan within a few years, then marched westward, directly confronting the Ottomans. In the §Y1402§! Battle of Ankara, the Ottoman ruler §YBayezid I 'the Thunderbolt'§! was captured alive by Timur, and the Anatolian empire he had built collapsed in an instant. Warlords across the land declared independence, and the previously subjugated Rum and Seljuks pledged allegiance to Timur.\n\nHowever, in an unexpected turn of events, Timur drank too much at his victory banquet and, ignoring dissuasion, insisted on riding his horse at full speed, ultimately falling to his death. After Timur's death, his empire lacked a strong successor, and his vast but loosely held realm quickly fell into disarray. His subordinates and previously conquered vassals declared independence. §YMuhammad§!, the son of Bayezid I who had died in prison, immediately returned to his homeland, defeated his brothers, and reestablished the Ottoman dynasty. He had been captured alongside his father in the Battle of Ankara but had received a Confucian education under the Mongols.\n\nAfterward, Timur's remnants retreated to Transoxiana, but the chaos in Anatolia was far from resolved.

The caliphs of §YFatimid§! and §YAbbasid§! vied for the title of orthodoxy, never imagining that one day they would both be buried in the sands of Arabia. In the late Fatimid period, frequent succession crises and the powerful viziers led to several schisms within the Shiite community. In §Y1130§!, the Fatimid Imam Amir was assassinated by the Nizari of Alamut, and his young son §YTayyib§! became the new caliph. However, Amir's cousin §YAbd al-Majid§! usurped the position of Imam and Caliph, taking the title §YHafiz§!, and Tayyib disappeared, presumed dead.\n\nIn fact, Tayyib did not die that night of turmoil. Under the escort of Yemen's chief missionary §YLamar§!, Tayyib and his loyalists were secretly sent to Yemen, a vassal of the Fatimids, where §YQueen Arwa§! of the §YSulayhid§! dynasty and Yemeni missionaries secretly raised the caliph. Subsequently, the Shiite community split again into the Hafiz and Tayyib factions, and Tayyib's followers, to protect the Imam's safety, declared a renewed period of occultation for the Imam.\n\nBut the Fatimid dynasty's fate was sealed. In §Y1171§!, the desert eagle §YSaladin§! formally deposed the Fatimid caliph, marking the end of this Shiite caliphate. The successors of the Sulayhid dynasty, the §YZurayids§!, could not withstand the Ayyubid blade.

Under continuous rebellion from Arabs and disloyal vassals, the Ayyubids gradually lost control of the peninsula, and now only the §YHashim§! family of the two holy cities, supported by Saladin, nominally remains loyal to Egypt.\n\nThe Abbasid caliphate was destroyed by the Mongols, and after the Baghdad massacre, these Mongols crossed the strait and landed in Hormuz. The Gulf lords were powerless to resist, and the Ilkhanate established the §YGovernorate of Tianfang§! before hastily withdrawing their troops to focus on Anatolia. After Timur's invasion of Persia, the Mongol governors in Arabia, like other vassals, quickly broke free from Mongol control, although their Confucian culture had already spread in the Gulf region.\n\nWith the surrounding threats gone, the Tayyibiyya clerics sensed the time was right and finally announced the reappearance of the §YFatimid§!

Ghana and its vassals were forced to convert to Islam, and the empire gradually declined, with its rich northern provinces being assimilated by the Almoravids.\n\nHowever, the fierce attacks of the §YCrusaders§! eventually pushed the Almoravids into the abyss. The §YMoroccan Uprising§! of §Y1147§! plunged the Maghreb into chaos, and the subsequent surprise attack by §YEl Cid§! completely destroyed it. The remnants of the Almoravids had to flee across the Sahara Desert to West Africa. The beleaguered order could only lick its wounds in the sands, allowing the southern tribes to rise again. The former vassals of Ghana grew stronger, surpassing their old master, with §YMali§! emerging as the most powerful among them.\n\nMeanwhile, in distant Greece, a shameful Crusade ended an ancient kingdom. The last emperor of the §YLaskaris§! dynasty, §YTheodore I§!, boarded a massive fleet with all the empire's heritage, determined to flee far away in search of support. Accompanying him were the §YKomnenos§! family, Greek nobles, and a large number of refugees. They wandered without any monarch willing to take them in. But as they sailed past Iberia towards Britain, a fierce storm disoriented the fleet. After a painful ordeal, the Greeks accidentally reached an unfamiliar land—the coast of West Africa.\n\nThe storm scattered the Greeks into two different fleets. Theodore led the largest fleet to land on the §YJolof§! coast. The locals were no match for the Roman fleet equipped with Greek fire, and he quickly established rule over the land, calling it §YElysium§!, meaning the beautiful new world. Meanwhile, the Komnenos brothers, Alexios, led another fleet to land in §YBenin§!, where the Yoruba tribes quickly submitted to them. Thus, a kingdom known as §YNew Macedonia§! was established in Benin.\n\nDuring New Macedonia's military expansion, an army broke away from the main force. Its leader claimed to be the last emperor of the §YDoukas§! dynasty, §YAlexios V§!, and led his troops to Lake Chad to declare himself emperor.

The Greeks began to consolidate their rule and expand their colonies.

Under constant conflict and military pressure, Mali formed the §YMandé Federation§!, becoming an unshakable power in West Africa.\n\nBut as time passed, the despicable foreigners grew stronger in West Africa, while the Mandé Federation declined.

After the death of §YCharles I§!, his eldest son §YWenceslaus§! inherited the Bohemian throne, while his second son §YSigismund§! received the crown of Hungary. However, the ambitious Sigismund was dissatisfied with his father's arrangement, especially when his timid and incompetent brother was listed as an alternative king by Hungarian opposition.\n\nIn §Y1384§!, the Dean of Theology at Prague University, §YJan Hus§!, led a vigorous church reform movement, which was met with disdain by many Bohemian nobles and the church. §YWenceslaus IV§!, frequently hindered by the nobles, chose to support Hus and his followers, appointing Jan Hus as the rector of Prague University. Meanwhile, his Hungarian brother incited the Bohemian nobles. This prolonged struggle, known as the '§YHussite Movement§!', caused Wenceslaus IV to have a strained relationship with the nobles for years.\n\nIn §Y1414§!, Pope §YMartin V§!, supported by Sigismund, convened the §YCouncil of Constance§! to discuss the Hussite issue. However, within the church, Jan Hus and the reformists advocating church reform gained the upper hand, and the council ultimately chose a moderate stance to engage with Jan Hus. After years of effort, in §Y1419§!, Jan Hus reconciled with Rome, and the church agreed to gradually implement reforms and recognize some of Hus's religious measures, appointing him as the Archbishop of Bohemia. Thus, peace was restored.\n\n§MPresent§!\nHowever, the §YTaborites§!, composed of grassroots believers, were not satisfied.

However, the new king acted tyrannically, imposing heavy taxes and suppressing peasants and the Taborites, hoping to curb the Hussites' growing influence. But the king's brutal actions ignited public anger. In §Y1430§!, the king arrested a large group of Hussite believers, and radical followers took to the streets. Prague councilors were thrown out of the town hall windows by the angry mob, igniting the powder keg of the '§YHussite Wars§!'.\n\nThe aging King of Hungary had not abandoned his ambitions. With Sigismund's strong support, Wenceslaus V was defeated and sought aid from Europe to form a Crusade.

She found the king's commander, claiming to be guided by the Archangel Michael to save the land of God from the pollution of the misguided.\n\nHer unwavering determination and extraordinary demeanor left a deep impression on the king, and the Bishop of Prague attested to her piety and righteousness. In desperation, Wenceslaus V agreed to appoint her to lead the king's army. Ultimately, this maiden, blessed by God, did not disappoint the king's trust. She was invincible on the battlefield, slaying the Silesian Count who supported the rebels and defeating the Hussite army.
