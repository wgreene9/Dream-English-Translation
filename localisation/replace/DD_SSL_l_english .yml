DD_LSK.0.dec:0 "Boniface de Montferrat, amidst the smoke of the Fourth Crusade, founded the Kingdom of Thessalonika through formidable courage and lofty prestige. He married Margaret of Hungary, widow of Isaac II Angelos. Through this union, he gained recognition from the remnants of Byzantine nobility and initial legitimacy in the eyes of the Greek people.\n\nYet the Latin Kingdom's foundations proved unstable. Boniface's sudden death, coupled with the oppression and forced conversion of Greek subjects by Latin lords, intensified internal turmoil. Over decades, Thessalonika faced multiple sieges, nearly fell to the Bulgarian Empire, and ultimately submitted to the Latin Empire amid shifting powers. The kingdom found respite under Boniface's son Demetrius, who eased internal conflicts and skillfully maneuvered for his second son Henry to inherit the Duchy of Thessaly, ruling these mountainous lands.\n\nThe Montferrat branch thus took root in Thessaly. Through centuries, we steadfastly guarded the kingdom's southern frontier, our bloodlines gradually blending with the land through generations of marriage with local nobles. Yet in the 1430s, the crown of Thessalonika finally collapsed under internal strife and external threats. The incompetent and cowardly William III was forced into exile in Italy, leaving us holding this remote corner. Fortunately, today's duchy has shed its former extremism, permitting Greek subjects to keep their faith while carefully maintaining relations with the Papacy. Our court preserves Latin Church traditions while incorporating Greek customs and etiquette. Thus, the local people gradually see us as protectors rather than foreigners.\n\nNow, the Empire of Thessalonika teeters on the brink, its rule over Epirus shattered through our machinations. The Komnenos Doukas family has lost control around the Pindus mountains, and our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] seizes this moment to rekindle the ambition of the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] dynasty. Perhaps the embers of Thessalonika may yet burst into flames once more."

Now, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] orders the reorganization of knightly orders and mercenary companies, summoning clerics to preach along the riverbanks, shaping this war as the beginning of a great new crusade. War horns and hymns echo through military camps, where armored knights and pontoon bridges stand ready.\n\nThe Danube will no longer be just a barrier, but shall become a bridge for imperial expansion. Should we cross this river in the name of the Cross, the Empire will not only purge heresy and rebellion but bring the entire Balkans under Catholic order."

The killings and plunder brought by the Fourth Crusade still sting in memory: it was a tearing of faith, a disgrace of fratricide, the nightmare of an empire's collapse, and many still whisper curses about those years of blood and fire.\n\nYet Boniface's legacy never truly died. From the moment he raised his royal standard in Thessalonika, our dynasty has borne the names of outsiders and usurpers, surviving with difficulty amid suspicion and hatred. The old divisions were forcibly healed through baptism by iron and blood, with brutal struggle bringing unified order. Though the path was strewn with thorns, a new empire now stands proudly upon the ruins. Generations have passed, and Latin blood has gradually blended with Greek soil. We inherit Roman Catholic traditions while using Greek customs to pacify the people. Through this cruel trial, we have finally taken root, becoming new guardians.\n\nNow the Empire under Latin rite has been reestablished. Former divisions were mended with iron and blood, brutal struggles bringing new unity. Rhomanía reappears in daylight—no longer a ghost of the past, but a kingdom in the present. The wound of the Great Schism may not heal easily, but the new empire stands upon the ruins, bearing Greek lineage and Latin faith, destined to recreate the prosperity, harmony, and splendor of the old Empire.\n\nMay our descendants remember not only the darkness of our internecine strife, but how we forged order and empire anew from flames and ruins."

In the ports of Constantinople and Thessalonika, shipwrights work day and night building galleys, while knights assemble in formation at the docks, ready for deployment. Merchant reports arrive: Egypt's fertile delta lies within reach, and Alexandria's port is the key to the Nile and Eastern trade routes.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] gazes upon the blue sea and distant sails, knowing that capturing that ancient city would allow the Empire to completely control the Eastern Mediterranean's lifeline under the Cross's protection.

DD_LSK.4.dec:0 "Boniface de Montferrat was originally the consensus leader of the Fourth Crusade, possessing both lineage and prestige, sharing ancestry with the Kingdom of Jerusalem and marital ties with the former imperial family. When Constantinople fell, both knights from the West and remaining locals believed the imperial crown rightly belonged on his brow. Yet Venetian schemes and Frankish ambitions changed everything. Villehardouin and Brienne wove conspiracies, joining with Baldwin of Flanders to strip him of his rightful inheritance through manipulated elections, placing the crown upon the head of the aged but still ambitious 'blind' Enrico Dandolo. That moment of humiliation became deeply engraved in Montferrat family memory.\n\nToday, fortune's wheel has finally turned. Hagia Sophia's bells still echo, monastic chants resound, candle flames flicker, and gilded icons gleam. [Root.Monarch.GetName], as Boniface's descendant, slowly enters the sanctuary, draped in luxurious robes, wearing the sword and regalia inherited from the Kings of Thessalonika. Clerics chant Latin prayers, holding crosses and gospels; knights stand solemnly with banners, griffins and crosses interwoven. Though cold observers remain, they cannot diminish this moment's solemnity. The Archbishop solemnly raises the jeweled crown, places it upon his head, anoints his brow with holy oil, and proclaims him 'Emperor of the Romans, Lord of the Greeks.'\n\nThe crowd's reaction is complex yet fervent: some call this God's righteous repayment, redemption for past conspiracies; others fear whether old grievances and betrayals might reignite beneath this imperial crown. Yet the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] remains solemn and resolute, knowing this act represents not only coronation glory but belated justice.

For the first time, the Roman successor of the East and the Holy Roman Emperor of the West gaze upon each other across the river.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] inspects the fortresses and villages along the shore, realizing this river is no longer merely a geographical boundary, but a silent barrier between claims to Roman legitimacy. Reports from merchants and scouts confirm: Imperial forces stand vigilant on the opposite bank, not yet arrayed for open battle, but currents stir beneath the surface.\n\nThough bells and prayers still echo across the border, the air is thick with tension and suspicion.

Bishops and missionaries have arrived with the armies, erecting temporary altars upon the riverbanks, ready to welcome receptive souls with holy water and Mass. Knights stand guard over these rites, while local nobles watch cautiously, knowing their choices will determine their families' futures.\n\nSome advocate forced conversion by fire and sword, to swiftly bring the entire river valley under Rome; others urge gradual change, winning hearts through trade, intermarriage, and the slow replacement of rituals.

As both inheritors of Greek lineage and guardians of the Roman Catholic faith, we can offer the local Griko people new security.

Missionaries carry gospels and icons, spreading the Roman faith village by village, town by town; Latin knights preside over rites in the towns, bestowing holy water and chrism; while local nobles who accept conversion are granted privileges and lands to secure their loyalty.\n\nMany former monasteries have been converted into cathedrals, reconsecrated by clergy using Latin liturgy, and in rural marketplaces, new feast days gradually replace ancient celebrations. Though resistance and schism persist, generations of youth increasingly regard Roman Catholicism as the sole true path.\n\nNow, the Slavic lands begin to transform under the Cross's protection, the Empire's authority strengthened through religious unity.

DD_LSK.41.dec:0 "To my dear child, Demetrius:\n\nIt was at twilight, with candlelight flickering on stone walls and hymns echoing slowly through the hall, that I married your mother—a daughter of the exiled Mélissenoi. Her family had fallen in strife, her brothers driven out in power struggles, and she herself was sent by fate's currents into my precarious duchy. That day held no laughter nor music, only solemnity and restraint.\n\nTo be frank, it was no romantic union. Between us lay no past admiration or tenderness, only the necessity of bloodline continuation and the silent calculations between noble houses. Yet as she slowly approached me, her robe sweeping across cold flagstones, I saw the glimmer of tears and stubborn pride in her eyes. In that moment, my heart stirred—not with passionate love, but with a warmth like a winter hearthfire. Perhaps in her heart, I appeared the same: a stranger, yet someone she must rely upon.\n\nYou must understand, my child, in my younger days I traveled to Italy for study, walking Milan's stone paths, residing in Pavia's colleges, leaving footprints in Piedmont's valleys, witnessing legal debates in Bologna's halls, and hearing theologians' lectures in Padua. I delighted in poets' rhythms and immersed myself in historians' chronicles. In those days, I believed words and ideals could shape destiny; I debated eloquently in grand halls, confident such wisdom and rhetoric could persuade allies and convert foes.\n\nYet such scholarly brilliance ultimately failed to teach me how to face conspirators' whispers or withstand cold steel cavalry. They became my background, making me understand through harsh reality that life consists not merely of poetry and rhetoric, but of weighty vows paid for in blood and tears. Thus your birth sprang not solely from cold transaction. Your mother's tenderness and my oath intertwined in that twilight, forming a subtle, hidden affection. Silent, yet it continues bloodlines; fragile, yet it withstands storms. Remember this: our house endures not through fleeting pleasures, but through suffering, vows, and that small, inextinguishable spark of love.\n\n—John de Montferrat"

In that moment, I saw your mother's weary yet peaceful smile, and saw how your swaddling clothes seemed to ignite the room's final light. I understood then that fate had not entirely abandoned us—it had left a new beginning in you.\n\nI named you 'Demetrius,' after the patron saint of Thessalonika. This signifies not only protection but also a solemn mission. You carry not just the bloodlines of Mélissenoi and Montferrat, but this war-torn land's yearning for the future. My child, you are the brightest torch in my life. May your path be less tortuous and dark than mine has been.\n\n—John de Montferrat"

That night, I broke the oath I had sworn to the Emperor of Thessalonika, raising the banner of rebellion alongside them.\n\nThe Komnenos Doukas family abruptly lost their lands in Epirus and Thessaly. At dawn, as our banners flew once more upon the battlements, I seemed to see our ancestors' shadows watching me. Though achievements were finally made—I had thought this would stir my soul with triumph—my heart found no peace. For I understood this was victory through betrayal, a 'tainted victory' undeserving of honor.\n\nThose conspiratorial whispers, those shattered oaths, those abandoned former allies... all left their mark upon my soul. I often gaze into your mother's eyes at night, yet dare not speak. She is a daughter of the Mélissenoi, who should take pride in honor and loyalty, yet now lives shadowed by my betrayal. I fear even more for you—that one day men might call you the conspirator's son, burdening you with shame not your own.\n\nMy child, should you inherit these lands one day, I pray you never face my predicament—compelled to secure victory through subterfuge, to build achievements upon betrayal. May you stand upon my shoulders to earn the imperial crown through justice and mercy, making men follow from admiration rather than fear or calculation.

Years of exile and humiliation seemed finally soothed at this moment. For I could now walk these streets with head held high—a scion of the long-declined Montferrat branch, who found opportunity amidst marginalization and oppression to raise the royal banner of Thessalonika once more. To me, this was nothing short of miraculous grace.\n\nLong-absent cheers filled the streets, church bells echoed beneath the dome. I no longer need to avoid the tears in your mother's eyes, nor fear you being called the conspirator's son. Seeing the welcoming smiles of the people, hearing their devout prayers, my heart simply thought: perhaps now I can use this city to protect you, allowing the bloodlines of Mélissenoi and Montferrat to continue here in peace.\n\nDemetrius, this is not the justice praised by the world, but my belated solace—the dignity I could win for you and your mother. Our name should not forever be written in chapters of decline. If all we have today was gained through fortune, then tomorrow, you must make it truly secure and glorious.\n\nMay you earn the world's admiration through courage and integrity, washing away the conspiracy and betrayal I carried.

Yet today, beneath Hagia Sophia's dome, hearing bells and hymns resound for me, feeling that jeweled crown rest upon my brow, I finally understand: striving with all one's might against fate can indeed yield achievements beyond imagination.\n\nThis is no mere fortune, but the weight of calling. For I know deeply that this honor belongs not to me alone, but to your mother's steadfastness through darkest hours, to the names of Mélissenoi and Montferrat flowing in your blood. It was our shared sacrifices and perseverance that raised this crown from past humiliation. My child, my greatest joy lies not in being called Emperor by the world, but in being able to proudly tell you and your mother: from this day forward, you need never lower your heads again to rumors and shame. The moment of your birth gave me courage to persevere, and now I wish to make this crown the foundation for your future.\n\nMay you inherit not merely my position, but this duty of guardianship. When you come of age, may you rule with integrity and mercy, earning the world's respect through wisdom and faith.

In this life, I exhausted myself for family and city, surviving amidst blades and undercurrents, persisting through schemes and betrayals. Though achievements were made, they often carried shame. I hope you inherit my devotion to protecting our bloodline, but not my ignoble methods. May you walk a brighter path, making men follow through mercy rather than fear, earning glory through integrity rather than conspiracy.\n\nYet before parting, I must speak of your mother. My child, always remember—she is this family's true pillar. During my campaigns, she alone remained, bearing every burden. She taught you prayers in childhood, taught you reading and writing; through perilous times, her resilience and tenderness comforted you and all in our household. She poured her youth and gentleness into this family, while I too often left her in my shadow. Though my love never wavered, what I gave her was often solitude and waiting.\n\nIf one thing burdens me with lasting regret, it is failing to grant her equal honor and peace. Child, protect and remember her in my stead. May you inherit both your mother's fortitude and compassion, and my determination to safeguard our house. When you tread paths I could not complete, may you bear no shame, but rightfully wear that crown—making the world follow from admiration, not submission from fear.

It calls you to transcend all baseness, to sustain it not through conspiracy, to rule not through fear, but to establish it upon foundations of justice and mercy. Do not forget the hunger of the poor, the loyalty of warriors, the prayers of the Church. The Empire belongs not solely to the monarch, but to millions of souls.\n\nThe imperial crown upon your brow is also the cross upon your shoulders. May you bestow mercy upon the people, restore dignity to the Church, and lend authority to the imperial diadem. Let men call you true Emperor of the Romans—not by bloodline, not by conspiracy, but because you have rightfully earned recognition from God and mankind.

This was where his mother had often retreated for quiet convalescence before her final illness, and the very air seemed to retain her presence. At dusk, while casually perusing old archives, he unexpectedly found, tucked within a yellowed devotional text, an unsent letter. The handwriting was elegant yet slightly unsteady, seemingly the final words his mother had left behind.\n\n『To my dear son, Demetrius:\nMy child, I never shared your father's inclination for recording the past, yet before God's summons, I still wish to leave you some words.\n\nI still remember the day I first met your father. I was young then, forced to leave my homeland and kin. My retinue was sparse, the wedding arrangements bleak and oppressive; hymns echoed through the empty hall, yet held no joy. I maintained proper decorum and dress, but couldn't conceal the trepidation and sorrow in my heart. Your father was taciturn, his brow shadowed with gloom, and he offered no words of comfort. In that moment, filled with resentment, I believed myself merely a sacrificial offering from a declining family.\n\nYet time gradually softened my bitterness. I saw how he swallowed humiliation and struggle alone, how he paced through countless nights until dawn, and how, at the moment of your birth, he showed for the first time an awkward yet genuine smile. Only then did I understand—he wasn't cold, but bore all pain within, unwilling to share the burden with us.\n\nDemetrius, your father gave you bloodline and name, while I gave you day-and-night guardianship. It was I who guided your small hand to form its first letters, who taught your first prayers by flickering candlelight. Your father was often away; feasts and revelry never belonged to this home, and all domestic burdens fell upon me. I never complained, for seeing you sleep peacefully was my deepest consolation.\n\nMy child, my sole wish is this: whatever position you may hold, never lose warmth. The Empire's swords may strike enemies, but you must learn to protect hearts. May you inherit your father's fortitude while preserving some of your mother's tenderness. When you were young, I often whispered: \"You need not retread the paths we walked.\" Today, I write these words, hoping you remember them always.\n\n—Eudokia Melissene』"

Trust between neighbors vanishes, former congregants now denouncing each other as heretics. Streets fill with rumors and resentment, as if the city still burns with Crusader flames—only now the fire is faith's rupture.

Today, the people of [Root.GetName] voluntarily adopt Latin rites, accept episcopal guidance, and participate in blessings and festivals within Catholic churches.

Yet today fortune's wheel has turned full circle—[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] leads triumphant armies back to Montferrat's hills. Though weathered by time, the ancient castles and stone walls still stand resolute, as if awaiting their rightful lord's homecoming. The people gather by city gates and mountain paths with mingled astonishment and apprehension, whispering: Can this foreign ruler truly become their protector once more?\n\nThe de Montferrat lineage has been renowned since medieval times as a house of chivalry, its bloodline flowing with valor and honor. Today knights raise the family banners, icons and crosses gleaming in sunlight. Old retainers and new allies assemble here, vowing to restore Montferrat's prestige. Where the house was once famed for iron resolve and courage, they shall now bear the epithet 'Iron Mountain,' symbolizing unshakable foundation and glory. The Empire endures not only in foreign lands, but takes root anew in its ancestral home."

Formerly divided principalities, arrogant republics, and stubborn duchies have all bowed to Imperial authority.\n\nAs the Iron Crown is solemnly placed, [Root.Monarch.GetName] is no longer merely [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], but inherits the mantle of Caesar and Augustus, bearing the honorific of Basileus with the majesty befitting King of Kings. This is both an echo of the old era and the dawn of a new age; it proclaims that a unified Empire has been reborn at the confluence of East and West. The Crown of Italy represents not merely territorial dominion, but the restoration of authority and civilization.\n\nWith the gem-studded Iron Crown reverently placed upon the brow, the Empire's prestige reaches its zenith once more. Rome and Greece, East and West, seem finally united as one at this moment. The Empire's history turns a new page, and Rome's scepter shall once again point toward the entire world."

Yet now, by divine providence, we stand as triumphant defenders of the faith, privileged to reopen this long-dormant vessel of the covenant.\n\nWhen our esteemed [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] personally unsealed this gold-overlaid sacred ark, the chamber fell into profound solemnity: the two stone tablets bearing the Ten Commandments, Aaron's staff, and the jar of manna appeared before mortal eyes, exactly as scripture records. Present clergy raised prayers in loud voices, praising the Lord's greatness and His favor upon the Empire of [This.GetName].\n\nFrom that moment, [This.GetName] has been enveloped in an unprecedented divine radiance.

When sunlight falls upon its surface, the clear waters surge between stone crevices, gleaming like the touch of the Heavenly Father upon earth. All present bow in reverence, declaring this another divine miracle bestowed by God.\n\nAs our esteemed [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] approaches the springside, the waters shimmer with crystalline brilliance, as if reflecting heavenly glory upon the mortal realm. Clergy murmur prayers, soldiers stand in breathless solemnity, and all firmly believe: through this sign, God reveals that the Empire of [This.GetName] is not merely Christianity's protector, but heaven's very reflection and vessel on earth. Henceforth, the entire Empire basks in unprecedented hope. We shall guard this sacred spring with utmost sincerity and piety until Judgment Day arrives, ensuring the Empire's destiny endures alongside eternal light."

The princes of Rus bow to the Holy See's authority; even the Holy Roman Empire's crown dims before our majesty.\n\nThe Ark's reappearance, the Fountain of Youth's surge—the prophecies of saints are fulfilled in our age. Miracles are no longer distant legends but heralds of a new realm. Men no longer call us [This.GetName], for upon this earthly plane, the Kingdom of Heaven has descended, and we have become—the Celestial Empire on Earth."
