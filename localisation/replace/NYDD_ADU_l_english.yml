 DD_ADU_1_t: "Legacy of the Eagle"
 DD_ADU_1_d: "From glory to decline, from unity to fragmentation, from the radiant dawn to endless night, from the pinnacle of prosperity to the abyss of decay... This encapsulates centuries of Andalusian history, and perhaps that of the entire Islamic world.\n\nSince the Islamic storm swept from the Arabian deserts to conquer the corrupt and incompetent Visigothic Kingdom, it destroyed the ignorant darkness of Christian Iberia, allowing Allah's eternal light to shine upon this land of limitless potential. It brought peace, prosperity, and tranquility, establishing centers of learning and culture that dispelled the ignorance shrouding Europe like the morning star.\n\nAfter the fall of the Umayyad dynasty, though Andalusia became mired in endless internal strife and fragmentation—giving the Christians hidden in northern mountains their so-called 'Reconquista' opportunity—they only managed to occupy the northern peninsula. They could never truly set foot in Andalusia, forever coveting with malice but never stretching their greedy hands toward its still-glistening jewels: Qurtuba and Ishbiliya.\n\nThe golden age of the Umayyads seems not so distant. The legacy of that great ruler who bore the Eagle's name, and his descendants' claim to the Caliphate, still shines brightly on history's most glorious pages. This beautiful land of Andalusia still upholds the Umayyad Caliphate's final spiritual authority under the Taifas. Despite frequent conflicts among themselves and growing threats from northern Christians, the rulers of these Taifas still harbor ambitions of restoring the empire's former glory, striving to become worthy successors to the Qurayshi Eagle's legacy.\n\nNow, three Taifas—sharing the same faith but with vastly different ideals, goals, and visions for the future—divide Andalusia. The Kingdom of Asturias, holding vast northern territories, watches hungrily, though this largest Christian realm in Iberia also shows signs of fragmentation and civil strife, much like the Umayyads of old...\n\nThe southern cities await the next great ruler and empire capable of restoring their past splendor. The war-torn and suffering people await the Eagle's return—whether it be the militaristic Badajoz Junta, the ambitious Granada proclaiming itself the Caliphate, or the diplomatic and silver-tongued Seville. Andalusia, long dormant in the age of division, now waits amidst ashes and prayers for its next rebirth."

 DD_ADU_2_t: "Death Before Dishonor" # Broken Jade or Whole Tile - the meaning is not obvious in English
 DD_ADU_2_d: "The Taifa era has brought us nothing but fragmentation. All know that unity alone offers salvation, yet the divides between hearts cannot be so easily bridged. Even with the infidel armies at our gates, the Taifas still fight separately. The temptations of power and wealth, like intoxicating wine, drive them to conflict. The seeds of ambition are deeply rooted in each Taifa's soil - none wish to play second fiddle.\n\nBut Allah has grown weary of mankind's ugly scramble for power. The flood of calamity approaches, the flames of Jahannam raise their scorching fangs, and fate no longer grants the Umayyad successors time to squabble over petty interests. If someone would but set aside their hatred, the Qurayshi Eagle might yet find room to soar - or else, clinging to their ambition, make the entire peninsula either the foundation of their throne... or the burial goods in their coffin."

 DD_ADU_3_t: "Settling Grudges"
 DD_ADU_3_d: "The division and civil wars of the Taifa era have long wearied our people. Brothers who should stand united against northern infidels instead view each other as mortal enemies. Court intrigues, factional strife, bloody massacres... Even glorious Qurtuba, inheritor of both Umayyad and Almoravid legacies, now lies under a shadow of unrest and turmoil.\n\nOur people yearn for peace and stability, though each generation of emirs struggles to balance relations with other Taifas, desperately seeking survival amidst threats of war. Yet all efforts seem futile - our peacemaking achieves nearly nothing...\n\nRecently, Emir [Root.Monarch.GetName] has attempted contact with the northern Christian kingdom of Asturias. A pact with them could secure vital support against our ambitious, wolf-like Taifa neighbors, though it may draw scorn from others. Alternatively, we might exploit this great Christian kingdom's current crisis to secure greater advantages for [Root.GetName]..."
 DD_ADU_3_d2: "Very well, it seems the rift between emirs cannot be healed. We must find another way."
 DD_ADU_3a: "Send envoys - I believe we'll find friends yet."
 DD_ADU_3a_tt: "When @ASU§OThe Asturian Civil War§! begins, we may send §Yaid§! to @LON§PLeón§!.\n\nIf they §Mprevail§! in the civil war, we shall form a §Galliance§!.\n"

 DD_ADU_4_t: "Execute the False Caliph"
 DD_ADU_4_d: "Since the fall of the Umayyad Empire, countless treacherous and greedy villains have emerged in Al-Andalus claiming to be the Caliph's successor. The Emir of Granada is clearly the most dangerous and notorious scoundrel among them. He brazenly proclaimed himself the False Caliph, deceiving nearly all the simple, good-hearted people of Al-Andalus. The Taifa of Granada has thus degenerated into his personal plaything.\n\nThe Islamic world cannot tolerate such a hypocritical and incompetent usurper occupying the Caliph's authority and position. Only our glorious military government can lead the people of Al-Andalus toward true peace and freedom. Now, we have defeated the last armies of the Granada Taifa and entered its ostentatious palace - a symbol of its corruption and sin - capturing the Emir who hid among his treasures. This so-called Caliph is merely a desperate, cowardly wretch.\n\nOnly death awaits him. We have prepared gallows for this titular Caliph and will pronounce his final judgment before all Granada's citizens, enumerating his crimes before his execution."
 DD_ADU_4a: "The False Caliph has been executed. Allah's true faith and light shall now be spread across all Al-Andalus by our glorious military government."
 DD_ADU_5_t: "The Reconquest of Al-Andalus"
 DD_ADU_5_d: "The armies of [Root.GetName] marched triumphantly - capturing Madrid, seizing Toledo, conquering Asturias and Galicia in the distant northern mountains. The Muslim vanguard swept through every city and village, raising banners inscribed with divine words beside the crosses of churches once cherished by Christian priests. The purifying flames of justice now blaze through the mansions and castles of those sinful Christian nobles who exploited their people, cleansing them of their crimes.\n\nChristian governors across the land have abandoned resistance, their zeal for the Cross and Reconquista drained by years of civil war and conflict. Today marks the final chapter in centuries of Christian-Islamic struggle in Iberia. Through this glorious jihad, we have expanded Muslim rule across nearly the entire peninsula, permanently neutralizing the northern Christian threat. The remaining petty kingdoms have no choice but to submit to our dominion."

 DD_ADU_6_t: "The Restoration of Al-Andalus"
 DD_ADU_6_d: "No great empire can escape its eventual decline and fall, yet such demise always leaves behind an immortal legacy awaiting ambitious and capable successors to reclaim. Now we have fully absorbed the other Taifas, achieving the glorious and stable unification of all Al-Andalus. The northern infidel threat has vanished, its embers of Christian crusades scattered into the vast river of history.\n\nThe golden age of the Umayyad Empire may seem distant, and the unification of Al-Andalus was once but a distant dream in the hearts of faithful warriors. Yet through Allah's protection and guidance, we have overcome countless obstacles, braved the darkness of division, and defied the fate of decline that doomed so many conquerors' descendants. What was once deemed fantasy has now become reality - these war-torn lands have been restored to their Umayyad-era splendor.\n\nWe conquered, we united, and through our endless faith in Allah we stand united under one sacred banner - for the future of Al-Andalus, for the bright and eternal future of the entire Islamic world."

 DD_ADU_7_t: "Return of the Eagle"
 DD_ADU_7_d: "Across Iberia's azure skies, the eagle symbolizing victory and glory soars alone. Its powerful wings, bathed in sunlight and moonlight, stir earth-shaking winds that sweep across the land. It has ended the corrupt rule of incompetent Christians, quelled chaos and civil war among Muslims, and spread Allah's divine message across these lands that knew centuries of turmoil - bringing news of victory and peace to all who awaited.\n\nWe once created glorious history under the Umayyad Caliphate, then lost all respect from nations due to endless internal strife. We struggled desperately through blood and tears, fought bitterly against enemies, and could only offer prolonged prayers to merciful Allah when faced with comrades' corpses and infidel atrocities... The Reconquista once pushed us to the brink, nearly swallowing even our last remnants in icy darkness. Yet we never abandoned hope, always believing Allah would grant us blades to conquer our foes, that the imperial legacy would never be buried but would rise again like dawn's first light.\n\nWe have proven again that ultimate victory belongs to Allah alone, witnessed Andalusia's eagle soar once more to conquer all enemies and fly toward distant horizons. Iberia's dark age is now but memory, and a new chapter for Al-Andalus begins - whether east or west, across any land or sea. Andalusia's eagle will proudly survey these territories, bringing eternal triumph."

This box shall hang from the highest tower in Seville, facing the endless sea - if all goes as planned. Though not yet a complete ending, this is enough to please [Root.Monarch.GetName] for now.\n\nSeville's past humiliations shall be cleansed with blood. The Umayyad legacy will soon be ours, and the time comes to lower the curtain on this bloody drama of power struggles. Hatred demands blood payment, glory belongs to the victors - vengeance needs neither flowers nor applause, only blood and Allah as our witnesses. Now, only the final enemy remains."
 DD_ADU_8a: "Blood for blood!"
 DD_ADU_9_t: "Finale of Vengeance"
 DD_ADU_9_d: "It is done. [Root.Monarch.GetName] held a grand procession through Seville, parading the families of his defeated enemies - the households of rival Taifas and the ringleaders of northern Christians. Our ancestors once trusted them naively, only to be torn apart by these wolves. With the entire city gathered, [Root.Monarch.GetName] triumphantly raised his sword, displaying the fate of his foes for all to see.\n\nThe chaotic era following the Umayyad collapse has finally ended by our hands. Those who betrayed Allah have been punished; rebellious infidels reduced to dust. Islam's blade has been unsheathed again across this peninsula, and this war-torn land stands united once more beneath Allah's banner. Now, none dare challenge our authority."

But suddenly he didn't want to run anymore. Everything he knew was being left behind, the surroundings growing increasingly unfamiliar. He was too tired, he didn't recognize this place. The yellow dust stirred up by the panicked crowd hung like a veil blotting out the sun, weighing heavily on Juan's heart with inexplicable dread. He missed his home.\n\nHis parents turned back, urgently grabbing his hands. Juan didn't want to run. He shook free and looked back at the billowing smoke behind them. 'Where are we going?' Juan stared blankly at the endless barren fields, the thunderous sound of fleeing footsteps pounding like relentless rain, like muffled war drums making his heart race uncomfortably. 'To a new home!' Juan felt his soul imprisoned in yesterday's land while his body was driven into tomorrow's wilderness.

The growing Kingdom of Asturias in the north now raises the cross-emblazoned banners, vowing to drive the 'infidels' from Iberia. The infidels' blades are at our doorstep, and the terrifying visions of Jahannam seem imminent.\n\nFacing the Christian threat, the Emir of [Root.GetName] has gathered envoys from all Taifas to swear an oath before Qurtuba's grand mosque - though brothers quarrel, they unite against outsiders. If we continue our infighting, we shall only see Frankish iron boots trampling Allah's courtyards. The Umayyad glory never truly faded, and we will not sit idle while infidels destroy our homes. After night-long negotiations, the three parties have agreed to set aside territorial disputes and form the Qurtuba Alliance, pledging to defend this last paradise Allah granted in the south."

Now we shall reclaim our ancestors' ambition and crush the Christian Reconquista.\n\nAs we declare war on northern Christian kingdoms, Allah's armies gradually recover our lands.

In his mind's eye, he could see bishops with sashes, nobles and gold-robed clergy; noblewomen, courtiers, aristocrats with their families; soldiers, town militia, sailors, merchants and their retinues; columns of armored knights, countless cross-bearing crusaders from many nations; and the Aragonese king and queen themselves. All the splendor of the knightly era gathered here, shining like stars. Above the vibrant costumes, ornate shields and glinting steel, the clamor of common folk intermingled with triumphant music.\n\nBut those were bygone days. Now, at this very moment, outside the city walls on the green plains, countless zealous Muslims surrounded this soon-to-be conquered city. In their camps, a motley army made final preparations. This city's era, this people's and nation's time had passed. The long epic was finally reaching its conclusion - though not the happy ending one might have hoped for.

The mottled old walls, the lush green fields, the dappled morning light through trees... each scene flickered into view.\n\nThe moist, fragrant aroma of soil wrapped around his heart like silken cords, slowly tightening around the beast in his chest, making it whimper in its stifling cage. Yet by simply closing his eyes, he could pretend to be back there, for the breeze and moonlight here felt nearly identical.

This proposal stems from the Umayyad Caliphate's fatal weakness - its inability to effectively govern overextended territories.

Three days since abandoning his capital, perhaps his pursuers hadn't realized the last Ilkhan slipped away unnoticed, still distracted plundering Persian cities' piled riches.\n\nSuddenly, the Ilkhan spotted banners bearing Arabic script ahead. Terrified, he halted the carriage and hid among roadside rocks. Soon Muslim warriors found the pitiful khan. Two days later, he 'returned' to his capital - just his fat, bearded head mounted on the walls, warning all defiant Mongols."

 DD_ADU_50_d: "We naively believed completing the Reconquista would dispel Iberia's gloom. That infidel troubles would recede like tides, leaving our rule eternally secure. Obsessed with land and conquest, we never considered governing this ballooning empire - assuming the world would naturally kneel before us.\n\nYet reality proved otherwise.\n\nProlonged wars and religious conflicts left unhealed wounds - a fractured populace and endless strife. Our revenge and jihad rhetoric bore bitter fruit. We took the Franks' lands but not their souls. Hatred became a chasm dividing our nation along ethnic lines. Discrimination and vendettas dragged war-torn lands back into turmoil. While nobles' wars ended, the people's war had just begun."

The hatred and religious conflicts that plagued Iberia are retreating from Andalusia like ebbing waves, revealing the battered earth beneath. War and strife left our society like a ship barely afloat after terrifying storms.\n\nThough chaos is contained, hatred and prejudice won't dissolve easily. A united nation, a harmonious people, a tolerant society... what we dream of today shall one day be reality. A time will come when Iberia's children cease hostility, becoming one truly complete and harmonious people. We shall unite - we must unite."
 DD_ADU_51a: "A long road ahead..."

 DD_ADU_52_d: "After tides of ethnic hatred receded, Iberia remains in disarray. Having built our empire on zealotry and revenge, we now face the consequences alone. Our realm stands like a foundationless tower, its body deeply scarred.\n\nEven if hatred fades and divides bridge, its legacy lingers like parasitic worms, poisoning our nation. As fanatics departed, our government lost support, fracturing like our people. Those once devoted to our holy war now drift in confusion, while staunch radicals denounce us as traitors."

We've lost control - ethnic hatred, like a caged beast constantly rattling its bars, has now broken free from our restraints.\n\nThose who ride hatred's stallion will eventually be thrown. Now the fanatical masses rage uncontrollably. When we forged our throne with revenge and holy war propaganda, we surrendered our soul to madness. Today, we're swept along by expansionist fervor, clinging to iron-fisted doctrines. The cruel mask has grafted onto our faces, flesh fused with metal. War, endless war - only blood and fire await tomorrow."

Some ulama suggest [Root.Monarch.GetName] abandon centuries-old vows and fully convert this monastery into a mosque, eliminating Christian preserves."

The ancient crescent banner flies from North African deserts to Mesopotamian plains, as Berber sabers and Arab sails reweave the scattered Caliphate's legacy.\n\nAllah's radiance - that ancient emblem once buried deep in sands - now flies proudly once more. Andalusi calls to prayer have become Mediterranean war horns; tides from world's end surge toward Euphrates' banks again. The Islamic Golden Age's torch is relit, and this time, Allah's warriors shall restore our greatness and revive Islam's empire."

Through howling winds, the man couldn't see clearly, only feeling warm, sticky fluid on his face. The azure sky blurred into darkness.\n\n................................................\n\nHe's dead. The black-clad figure knelt to check, then turned to the shivering man beside the still-warm corpse."
