DD_CAS_SPA_6: "Order of Christ"
DD_CAS_SPA_6_desc: "Our crusaders possess unwavering faith and fanatical loyalty, matched by their advanced weaponry. From the wars against the Moors, the holy warriors of Iberia have gained invaluable experience and cutting-edge weapons, whether in open combat or sieges. Our military might is unparalleled in Europe, and with swords and muskets, we can crush any enemy foolish enough to challenge us, sending them to hell in the name of God."
DD_CAS_SPA_7: "§RDreams Delayed§!"
DD_CAS_SPA_7_desc: "The dream of the Spanish people—to establish a new Jerusalem on earth. Our rulers and bishops once promised our warriors and people that after the holy war, an infinitely bright future awaited, a world free of heretics, a pure faith that would be a true heaven on earth... But the horrors of war have left many with growing doubts and concerns... After the war, all we seem to have gained is endless §Rscorched earth§!..."

# Asturias
DD_ASU_reconquista: "Reconquista"
DD_ASU_reconquista_desc: "We broke free from the chains of the Muslims, starting from the region of Asturias, the birthplace of the Iberian Reconquista. Over seven hundred years have passed since then, and the long road ahead remains uncertain. Though we have faced setbacks, we have never given up. Our ancestors paved the way for the grand territory we possess today. Now, many regions of the Iberian Peninsula remain under the rule of infidels, with people suffering in misery, eagerly awaiting liberation. We must once again call upon the people to continue this great and glorious cause, pushing the Reconquista to new heights. As the starting point, we shall also be the endpoint of this path of revival, ending the Muslim ambitions in Iberia."
DD_ASU_camino_de_santiago: "Way of St. James"
DD_ASU_camino_de_santiago_desc: "St. James, one of the twelve apostles of Jesus, is said to have preached in Iberia, and after his martyrdom, his remains were buried here. After a shepherd discovered the tomb of St. James guided by starlight, our great Reconquista cause was also inspired by the guidance of the saint's soul. With the recognition of the Pope and the Franks, the Way of St. James became a new pilgrimage route for Christians, and we naturally became the sole guardians of this holy site and pilgrimage route. Promoting the value of St. James' tomb and protecting the Christians along the way is both our duty and an important means of uniting the people and strengthening the Catholic faith, greatly benefiting the stability of our realm."
DD_ASU_aristocracy: "Spark of Resistance"
DD_ASU_aristocracy_desc: "After the fall of the Visigothic Kingdom, we established the first Christian state in Iberia under the leadership of the Visigothic royal descendants. With such a long history, our nobility deserves a status befitting their dignity. Whether in assisting the Frankish Kingdom against the Umayyad Caliphate or maintaining good relations with the Pope and defending holy sites, our nobility has provided substantial financial and military support. At the same time, our nobles, both the main lineage and distant branches, are spread across various Catholic nations in Europe. They remain loyal to their roots even abroad, continuing to garner support for our Reconquista cause. We must echo their efforts while also appeasing the domestic nobility, harnessing this formidable force to enhance our reputation and solidify our rule."
DD_ASU_colonialism: "Oceanic Zeal"
DD_ASU_colonialism_desc: "This is an era of maritime power. Located in northern Iberia, we may not have the same convenience in exploring the seas as the Muslims who control Lisbon and Seville, but we possess an absolute natural advantage over other Catholic nations and the short-sighted Muslims. 'He who controls the seas controls all wealth and power,' as Prince Sancho I of Galicia once said—and he himself embodied this oceanic zeal. He not only oversaw the construction of ships and updated equipment but also personally embarked on voyages to explore uncharted waters. His spirit of adventure is commendable and has provided us with invaluable experience in maritime exploration and fleet construction. Our ships will sail toward the stars and seas, both to explore the unknown and to lay the foundation for our Iberian hegemony."
DD_ASU_millenarian_revival: "Millenarian Revival"
DD_ASU_millenarian_revival_desc: "The Reconquista has reached its dawn. Though darkness still lingers, the light is clearly visible. Despite the panic of defeatists who see clear signs of catastrophe, we remain steadfast in our belief that the light of the Holy Father will dispel the long night of Muslim rule, bringing peace and justice to every land from the Pyrenees to Gibraltar. When the saints return, they will usher in a golden age for the Iberian Peninsula. Our vision has gained increasing recognition among the people, drawing residents from surrounding regions to join our Reconquista cause. But before the saints return, we must also strengthen our missionary efforts, spreading the Gospel to every corner of Iberia to create the conditions for their return."
DD_ASU_unify_the_provinces: "Emperor of All Spain"
DD_ASU_unify_the_provinces_desc: "Just as Asturias holds a crucial position in the Reconquista, our monarch also possesses supreme prestige, known as the 'Emperor of All Spain.' As the master of all Spain, we naturally cannot allow foolish subordinates to divide our supreme power. Therefore, we must focus on eliminating regional decentralization and recentralizing authority. This will strengthen the absolute authority of our supreme monarch and effectively eliminate domestic instability, bringing all under the direct control of the king. As Carlos always emphasized, 'Only a strong monarch can create an invincible nation.'"
DD_ASU_early_industrialism: "Commercial Prosperity"
DD_ASU_early_industrialism_desc: "Asturias is the first and strongest bastion against Muslim invasion in Western Europe and also holds the commercial lifeline of the Catholic world. The discovery of coal resources laid the foundation for our initial industrialization, while the stabilization of domestic affairs provided a favorable environment for commercial development. The opening of new trade routes has brought constant traffic to our ports, mitigating the adverse effects of greedy Mediterranean merchants blockading the eastern coast. The exploration of the New World has brought us exotic local products, which quickly became the most sought-after goods in the Catholic world—our wealth is unmatched, and our commercial prosperity is undeniable."

DD_ASU_SPA_7: "§TThe Ship That Breaks the Waves§!"
DD_ASU_SPA_7_desc: "For a long time, we have pondered the path God has shown us amidst war and prayer, wondering what end it might lead to. To reclaim our lands, we launched multiple holy wars; to conquer France, we employed means that other Christians might deem dishonorable. We have achieved many victories, yet the price paid has not been too heavy. After ending this unprecedented large-scale turmoil, both the king and the common people silently arrived at an answer. God is not testing us in phases but is constantly observing us, punishing sins and rewarding good deeds—this is the mission of the Spanish people, to prove to the world that our hearts are unbreakable due to our faith in God, capable of overcoming any hardship."

DD_lon_heritage_of_the_reconquista: "Legacy of the Reconquista"
DD_lon_heritage_of_the_reconquista_desc: "Regardless of our ideals, we are the people of Carlos, the 'Emperor of All Spain,' the successors of Asturias, and the revivers of the Reconquista. Though we rule with virtue, we must not neglect our military. Over seven hundred years of struggle have instilled in our people a desire for peace, but also the strength to take up arms to defend it. A century of fighting the Moors has cultivated excellent commanders and soldiers across all classes, and their experiences, passed down through generations, have formed a gradually perfected combat system. Our tolerance has also attracted some former enemies, who, under our influence, have acknowledged our righteousness and begun to share their Eastern war experiences. Meanwhile, under the banner of the Reconquista, we have successfully gathered remnants of the Crusaders. Carrying the will of their ancestors, they have widely participated in military life, becoming the backbone of our army. Though we desire peace, the seven-hundred-year history of the Reconquista is no excuse for complacency. The cause of the Reconquista must never be abandoned."
DD_lon_leonese_cortes: "Leonese Court"
DD_lon_leonese_cortes_desc: "Though our court is not as ancient as Asturias', it remains one of the oldest in Iberia. Inheriting the noble status of Asturias, even as the Catholic world criticizes our tolerance, our nobility has actively worked to mainstream Catholic acceptance of our ideals, and peace in Iberia is within reach. The relaxed and open Leonese court welcomes all ancient and emerging families, as well as knowledgeable individuals of different religions to participate in court decisions. Thus, even Moors from the south are willing to serve our king. Our advisors fill the court and coexist peacefully, our monarchs are open to talent and trust without suspicion, and we have formed an efficient court politics. Out of love for the monarch, advisors are willing to give more to the court and take less. The united, efficient, and enlightened Leonese court will surely meet everyone's expectations, bringing a peaceful and prosperous future to Iberia."
DD_lon_patronize_leonese_language: "A Kind Heart"
DD_lon_patronize_leonese_language_desc: "Seven hundred years of war have exhausted people's zeal for war and religion, gradually affecting the psychology of the ruling class—our monarch is such a person. Can centuries of war truly bring peace to the people here? We often ask ourselves. The infidels... are merely different in faith and perspective. Is it worth waging crusades for so-called religious beliefs? Hatred never ends, and repaying evil with evil only brings endless suffering. Influenced by our open court life, our monarch has developed a kind heart. Turning swords into plowshares, laying down arms... we declare our friendship to our southern friends through actions and invite them to join hands in creating a beautiful future where Christians and Muslims coexist, all thanks to our monarch's kind heart."
DD_lon_nationalism: "Encouraging Moorish Communities"
DD_lon_nationalism_desc: "Under the influence of our open court atmosphere, our communities have gradually developed a friendly environment. Unlike other nations that exclude and persecute infidels, we choose to use caravans and contracts to create a new era shared by Christians and Muslims. The Moors, originating from the distant eastern Mediterranean, serve as a bridge linking the distant East and us, possessing remarkable business acumen and advanced production experience. Encouraging Moors to establish communities in our nation not only facilitates cultural exchange but also greatly benefits our production and commercial development. The Moors bring Eastern goods and production techniques, guiding us in commerce and production. Thanks to this, we can better integrate the various forces in Iberia, steadily moving toward Iberian unity."
DD_lon_conquistadores: "Saving the New World"
DD_lon_conquistadores_desc: "Our vision is not limited to peaceful coexistence with Muslims, nor is it confined to the small land of Iberia. Thanks to the precious voyage journal of Prince Sancho of Asturias, we have learned of a vast and still-primitive continent in the distant beyond. Our people are eager to establish an era of coexistence with the uncivilized peoples overseas. Upholding a tolerant and open religious policy, rescuing the New World from overly fanatical Christians who tend toward violence and conquest is now one of our key tasks. If we can place the uncivilized peoples under our protection first, we can help them avoid the tragedy that Iberia endured for over seven hundred years. Now, our ships sail to distant shores, not for conquest, but for redemption."
DD_lon_school_of_salamanca: "School of Salamanca"
DD_lon_school_of_salamanca_desc: "The School of Salamanca (Escuela de Salamanca) is an academic school developed by Christian theologians from Iberia during the Renaissance. Rooted in the University of Salamanca and benefiting from our open and free academic atmosphere, our scholars have made significant contributions to the development of economics, philosophy, and theology, providing valuable advice for our policies. The School of Salamanca's reflections on war have given our armies just cause; advocating religious tolerance has helped us attract more foreign, even infidel, talents; new economic frameworks have helped us alleviate financial pressures; and reflections on natural law have helped us perfect our laws and better govern the nation. The flourishing of the School of Salamanca is proof of our openness, tolerance, and academic excellence."
DD_lon_expand_navy: "Expanding the Leonese Navy"
DD_lon_expand_navy_desc: "Our sailors have shone on the seas, writing their own stories for hundreds of years. With the general rise of our maritime competitors, our naval pressure has also increased sharply. The competition for the New World has entered a new phase, and the maritime situation has changed dramatically, so it is time to expand our naval power. Whether to protect the peoples of the New World from religious persecution and massacres or to compete for naval supremacy in Europe and the Mediterranean, we undoubtedly need to accelerate the construction of our naval forces. Once we lose control of the seas, we will fall into the predicament of being surrounded by enemies and losing contact with our islands. Therefore, expanding our navy and strengthening our maritime power is also our urgent task. Peace and prosperity are built on strength, and we cannot afford to fall behind and be at the mercy of others."

DD_lon_leonese_cortes2: "Diverse Court"
DD_lon_leonese_cortes2_desc: "Though our court is not as ancient as Asturias', it remains one of the oldest in Iberia. Inheriting the noble status of Asturias, even as the Catholic world criticizes our tolerance, our nobility has actively worked to mainstream Catholic acceptance of our ideals, and peace in Iberia is within reach. The relaxed and open Leonese court welcomes all ancient and emerging families, as well as knowledgeable individuals of different religions to participate in court decisions.

DD_lon_nationalism2: "Peaceful Coexistence with the Moors"
DD_lon_nationalism2_desc: "Under the influence of our open court atmosphere, our communities have gradually developed a friendly environment. Unlike other nations that exclude and persecute infidels, we choose to use caravans and contracts to create a new era shared by Christians and Muslims. The Moors, originating from the distant eastern Mediterranean, serve as a bridge linking the distant East and us, possessing remarkable business acumen and advanced production experience. Encouraging Moors to establish communities in our nation not only facilitates cultural exchange but also greatly benefits our production and commercial development. The Moors bring Eastern goods and production techniques, guiding us in commerce and production. Thanks to this, we can better integrate the various forces in Iberia, steadily moving toward Iberian unity."
DD_LON_SPA_6: "§MMelting Action§!"
DD_LON_SPA_6_desc: "Our previous activities with the Moors went very smoothly. What seemed like an insurmountable peak only requires you to take the first step in communication. Solid ice can melt, and extreme cold cannot alleviate it in the slightest. We must become the sun, melting the ice in everyone's hearts."

DD_the_reconquista: "Ignite the Fire of Revenge"
DD_the_reconquista_desc: "Revenge! Revenge! We firmly believe that everyone who has witnessed the atrocities of the Muslims cannot suppress their fear and anger toward another world. However, over seven hundred years have passed in the blink of an eye. The Christians of this land have yet to see the dawn of victory in the Reconquista. Instead, their anger is obscured by internal strife, and their fear grows daily due to the incompetence of the ruling class and the volatile situation. But times have changed. We are born from the pioneers of the Reconquista and will surely surpass them! 'Do not let them fear, our Lord. The saints of Castile have returned to the world. They lead the people to reclaim the land promised by God.' Our theologians have reinterpreted the classics, rallying the once-exhausted people once more. We must dispel their fears, ignite their anger, and rekindle the dying fire of revenge in their hearts! We will drive the blazing flames to burn down the 'old world' that has enslaved Iberian Christians for centuries."
DD_spanish_inquisition: "Spanish Inquisition"
DD_spanish_inquisition_desc: "Compared to Alfonso, the traitorous son of Carlos I, the 'Emperor of All Spain,' our extreme stance against Muslims has won unanimous praise from the entire Christian world and secured the support of the Pope, one of the most powerful forces in Catholicism. The Pope personally visited our lands, endorsing our sanctity and justice, and helped us establish a religious court to judge heretics. The Spanish Inquisition will now serve as another front in our Reconquista, aimed at destroying the foundation of Muslim presence in Iberia. The Inquisition not only helps us strengthen missionary work through legal and widely recognized means but also makes us the true agents of God, surpassing other Catholic forces in Iberia. With the Inquisition, our Reconquista efforts are greatly enhanced, and we will crush our enemies with thunderous force. The cross we now hold tightly is undoubtedly the tomb of those traitors and sinners. 'God bless us.'"
DD_cabildos: "City Councils"
DD_cabildos_desc: "The 'Cabildo,' representing the interests of the city, has revived in Iberia, a land once far from God, after enduring the collapse of ancient Rome, the constraints of the Middle Ages, and the invasions of infidels. These councils have taken on the responsibilities of judicial and administrative management of the cities. As we improved and gained control over these councils, the management pressure on the cities has eased, promoting peace, stability, and the happiness of the people. Happy people bring civilization and poetry, peace welcomes endless caravans of merchants, and stability accompanies continuous prosperity. After long-term operation, no one questions the efficiency and role of the city councils anymore. Therefore, we should further promote them. Whether in the territories we currently hold, will hold, or will discover, city councils should be established to showcase our enviable local governance capabilities."
DD_inter_caetera: "Civilizing Mission"
DD_inter_caetera_desc: "Thanks to our pivotal role in the Reconquista and our firm religious stance, we have unequivocally declared ourselves the sole representatives of Spanish Catholicism and the heirs of the Reconquista, gaining recognition and support from the Vatican. The former strengthens our legitimacy, while the latter grants us the historical mission to liberate all uncivilized races. We are the most resilient and tenacious among the Catholic nations, and our people are the most visionary and dream-driven. The era of great maritime exploration led by the Prince of Galicia has ended, but the footprints of our predecessors mark the beginning of a new era of exploration. Our explorers brave the storms in the New World, while missionaries tirelessly work to civilize the wilderness. We are a nation of inheritance and creation, of piety and glory, destined to spread the Gospel and promote civilization."
DD_infantas: "In the Name of the Sword"
DD_infantas_desc: "No one desires war. Everyone wants to solve problems peacefully, but some issues cannot be resolved through fantasies of peace. As long as heresy exists, conflict will never cease. We have drawn the most devout and religious aspects from the legacy of Asturias and expanded upon them, making them the foundation of our nation. Today, Iberia is like a powder keg, and all we do is light the spark that ignites it. Religious fervor is the driving force behind our continuous progress, and the blood of infidels is the gift we offer to God. To stop violence with violence, to end war with war—this is the only truth to reintegrate Iberia under the banner of Catholicism. We act in the name of the sword, by the reality of the sword, toward the edge of the sword, and conquer where the sword points. At the same time, we must avoid the tragedy of previous Reconquista efforts being halted by a succession crisis. We must not only act in the name of the sword but also clearly establish an heir to ensure the Crusade never ends and the holy war burns brightly."
DD_salamanca_scholars: "School of Salamanca"
DD_salamanca_scholars_desc: "The School of Salamanca (Escuela de Salamanca) is an academic school developed by Christian theologians from Iberia during the Renaissance. With the rise of humanism, the Reformation, and the Age of Discovery, traditional Catholic concepts were challenged, and thus, the School of Salamanca emerged on this pious land. Rooted in theology and complemented by the emerging political and economic order, the School of Salamanca reshaped outdated ideas, proposing many novel and transcendent concepts. Based at the University of Salamanca, the School laid the foundation for the development of our theology, philosophy, and economics. Thanks to its advanced nature, it has also introduced new vitality into our nation-building. If we make good use of it, it can not only ensure an open intellectual environment domestically but also seek legal justification for our efforts to unify Catholic forces in Iberia, tracing back to the source and gaining broader recognition and support from the people."
DD_nueva_planta: "New Fundamental Law"
DD_nueva_planta_desc: "The wheel of time rolls forward, and our prosperity and greatness cannot stop halfway. However, as time passes, the old local administrative systems can no longer adapt to the new political, economic, and cultural ecology, thus ending their political life. At that time, the Catholic nations of Iberia united, leading to today's prosperity and the people's peace and contentment. Yet beneath the peace, undercurrents surge, and many regions still retain their autonomy, with occasional resistance against the central authority. It is time for them to recognize who truly holds power in Iberia. The old local institutions have been dismantled and reorganized, becoming the most stable part of our path to centralization. Those who once advocated autonomy now have nowhere to hide, their actions like those of clowns, ignored by all. Our entire nation has united under a new identity, bowing to the court of Castile. And we are the sole emperor of Iberia—this land blessed by God."

XLN_ideas_1_desc: "We are not just commoners but knights who defend our faith and homeland. Chivalry calls for unity and courage, and the true heirs of the Crusader banner can only be—us! Devout warriors spontaneously form stronger organizations under the light of the Lord, resisting invaders and bandits. For the future of Cyrenaica, every heart should burn with the flame of glory, and every sword should swing for freedom and honor!"
XLN_ideas_2: "House of Hauteville"
XLN_ideas_2_desc: "We will never forget that our hearts beat with the noble blood of the House of Hauteville. From Norman conquerors to Crusader heroes, our ancestors won glory in holy wars with bravery and loyalty, laying the foundation for Africa. It is their excellence that earns us respect and recognition in the West, even in infidel lands. Only they are the true masters of North Africa. Now, we must not only reclaim our past glory from thieves but also lead Africa to new heights amidst the storm."
XLN_ideas_3: "Norman Renaissance"
XLN_ideas_3_desc: "We will lead Africa into our golden age, integrating European culture, art, and science into our land, reviving ancient culture, and building a nation full of strength and wisdom. Grounded in reality and embracing diversity, we will move toward a stronger and more progressive future. Based on European roots, Africa is heading toward an unprecedented glorious future."
XLN_ideas_4: "Old Tactics"
XLN_ideas_4_desc: "Unlike the arrogant and cowardly who side with thieves, true great warriors understand that victory comes from the heritage and refinement of experience. For many years, we have never abandoned the old Norman tactics, continuously improving cavalry strategies, maneuvering between deserts and oases, striking before the enemy arrives. We rely on these tactics passed down from generation to generation to defend our land and achieve unexpected victories."
XLN_ideas_5: "Frankish-Latin Court"
XLN_ideas_5_desc: "We come from the lands of France, mixed with a large number of Latin advisors. Our court has become a crossroads of culture and intrigue. We continuously recruit outstanding talents from all over the world, making them the cornerstone of our nation's strength."
XLN_ideas_6: "The Last Crusaders"
XLN_ideas_6_desc: "We inherit the glory and blood of the Crusaders, shouldering the important task of shining the darkness with the glory of the Lord. Facts have proven that the usurpers of Africa are incompetent, and only we are God's chosen here. War and sacrifice will not deter our soldiers but will only make them advance; blood and hatred cannot shake the souls of the faithful, for the light of the cross will guide their future."
XLN_ideas_7: "Legion's Glory"
XLN_ideas_7_desc: "Cyrenaica has never succumbed to calm. Our banners always march forward, for conquest is our destiny. The blood of the Normans flows with an insatiable thirst for battle. Whether it is the shameless infidels or the arrogant old masters, all enemies will bow under our swords. War is the reason for our existence, and victory will be our eternal glory."

DD_knights_sprit: "Chivalry"
DD_knights_sprit_desc: "We are the descendants of the Crusaders, the chosen of the Lord. Our vast and invincible cavalry once swept across North Africa. Loyalty, bravery, and unity are the beliefs of every knight, and the points of blades and spears defend our faith and honor. The hoofbeats of warhorses will become the symbol of conquest and protection, and the iron-blooded knights swear to rule the battlefield with fearless hearts."

Now, the divine has given us a mission, and the sword and shield are the path to glory. Every devout warrior will once again take up arms. Every soldier will be engraved on the monument of conquest; every battle is a declaration of faith. We stand united, no matter where we are, fighting for the sacred mission."
AFR_ideas_3: "Standing Alone"
AFR_ideas_3_desc: "In the desolate lands of Africa, we stand isolated, surrounded only by hatred and hostility. Infidel armies attack us from all sides, and we must rely on our own strength to gain a foothold in this wilderness and defend our faith. Only by continuously strengthening our defenses can we preserve the glory that once belonged to the knights."
AFR_ideas_4: "Suppression Act"
AFR_ideas_4_desc: "If we only conquer their bodies, we cannot save their souls, leading only to betrayal and futile resistance. To ensure the unity of faith, we must mobilize the entire nation. The Church and the army will work together to bring the Gospel of Christ to every corner of Africa. The lands once ruled by Muslims will be purified, and the will of God will be carried out in every province."
AFR_ideas_5: "Unify Africa"
AFR_ideas_5_desc: "We are here not to suppress rebellions or maintain stability but to fulfill the sacred mission that must never be forgotten: to illuminate every inch of dark land with holy light. For glory and faith, the territories of the infidels must quickly come under our rule. Conquest is not just expansion but the continuation of divine will. Let every piece of African land flourish under our order and justice."
AFR_ideas_6: "Legacy of El Cid"
AFR_ideas_6_desc: "Corrupt and despicable leaders, soldiers with divided loyalties—these are things of the past. Our great ancestor, the knight El Cid, ventured deep into enemy territory alone, crushing enemy formations and securing a great victory for the Iberian League against the Muslims. Let the heroic spirit of El Cid continue to guide us; his blade will once again gleam coldly in our armies. We carry the glorious mission of our forebears, bringing order and honor to this land. Only through rigorous training and fearless will can we continue their legacy, forge an invincible army, and protect this nation that belongs to us."
AFR_ideas_7: "Desert Warfare"
AFR_ideas_7_desc: "On the scorching lands of North Africa, at the cost of blood, the Crusaders went from unfamiliarity to mastery, gradually adapting to the brutal battlefield of the desert. Now, the blazing sun, sandstorms, and drought are no longer obstacles but trials that temper the spirit of our soldiers. Every victory stems from a deep understanding of the desert environment and tactical adjustments, making Africa the master of desert warfare. Rooted in North Africa, we forge a fearless desert army."

BDH_ideas_3: "Meritocracy"
BDH_ideas_3_desc: "Our military government is not plagued by the religious conflicts that trouble most Iberian countries. In fact, as long as one has sufficient ability and military achievements, even non-Muslims can secure a place in our army and government. Whether local Moorish Muslims or Christians from the north, all can become members or even cadres of the military."
BDH_ideas_4: "Sweeping Al-Andalus"
BDH_ideas_4_desc: "The once prosperous and wealthy Al-Andalus has been divided for too long. The people yearn for a strong nation to end the endless wars and restore past glory. We are undoubtedly the most capable and qualified force to achieve this long-cherished wish. Al-Andalus is destined to be conquered by us!"
BDH_ideas_5: "Umayyad Legacy"
BDH_ideas_5_desc: "Although the Umayyad Dynasty, which once ruled almost all of Iberia, has perished, the military legacy it left us remains invaluable. The armies of the Caliph swept across Eurasia with few rivals, achieving illustrious feats. Like the Umayyad Dynasty of old, we will launch glorious conquests in the name of Allah, pursuing the honor of defeating our enemies."
BDH_ideas_6: "Conquerors of Allah"
BDH_ideas_6_desc: "We believe that it is Almighty Allah who has granted us the power to defeat our enemies and conquer their lands, the qualification to punish past enemies with the sword of fire. No other weak military force in Iberia can compare to us, for we always adhere to one truth: 'There is no victor but Allah.'"
BDH_ideas_7: "Battle-Hardened"
BDH_ideas_7_desc: "War is not only a test for the army but also a crucial test for a nation and its people. We have endured countless tough battles, emerging from the chaotic period of Taifa schism and Christian invasions. With unwavering faith in Allah and the determination to fight our enemies to the end, we have become the only force on the peninsula that advocates absolute force, an army with a state."

BDH_ideas2_1_desc: "Since our unification of Al-Andalus, our militaristic government could generously be called 'less than ideal'. We must reorganize to ensure generals serve only ceremonial roles while competent administrators handle actual governance."

BDH_ideas2_3: "Meritocratic Appointments"
BDH_ideas2_3_desc: "Our military government suffers none of the religious conflicts plaguing other Iberian states. Indeed, any person - Muslim or not - may earn position through merit and military achievement. Local Moorish Muslims and northern Christian converts alike can become core members of our forces."

BDH_ideas2_4: "Unified Al-Andalus" 
BDH_ideas2_4_desc: "We have ended Andalusia's wars, reuniting this prosperous land under one banner. Yet our work remains unfinished - many brethren still suffer under Frankish rule. We must liberate our people!"

BDH_ideas2_5: "Umayyad Legacy"
BDH_ideas2_5_desc: "Though the Umayyad dynasty that once ruled Iberia has fallen, its military heritage remains invaluable. The Caliph's armies swept across Eurasia virtually unchallenged.

DD_SEW_ideas_bonus: "Seville Ambitions"
SEW_ideas_1: "Revenge"
SEW_ideas_1_desc: "Traitors are common in this era. For the other Taifas that deeply hurt us, as well as the Almoravids and Crusaders, we will have our revenge! Their crimes against us are too numerous to record. We will not only reclaim our lands but also crush their rule!"
SEW_ideas_2: "Port of Seville"
SEW_ideas_2_desc: "Seville is the second-largest city in Al-Andalus, located in the midst of lush farmland, enjoying increasing prosperity. It is both a distribution center for the rich agricultural products of the surrounding regions and, thanks to the Guadalquivir River, a commercial port connecting it to the capital in the east and the Atlantic in the west. Muslim and Christian merchants travel between emirates with slaves and goods, while the Jewish merchant community known as 'Radhanites' controls long-distance trade, bringing goods from the Mediterranean, Eastern Europe, and even India and China into Al-Andalus through Seville. Even after Viking raids and the impact of the Al-Andalus civil war, Seville's wealth and glory remain undimmed."
SEW_ideas_3: "Remembering the Caliphate"
SEW_ideas_3_desc: "Since the death of Hisham III, the last orthodox Caliph of Córdoba, the Taifa states today are but pale shadows of the former Caliphate. The Caliphate was never formally abolished, but no one cares. Members of the Umayyad and Hammudid families still claim the title of Caliph, and many Taifa rulers like to maintain the illusion that the authority of the Umayyad Caliph still exists. By pretending to be agents of a ghost Caliph, their legitimacy is not questioned."
SEW_ideas_4: "Christian Allies"
SEW_ideas_4_desc: "The relationship between Christian and Muslim states on the Iberian Peninsula is not the life-and-death struggle traditionally believed. Instead, Christian kingdoms and Taifa states have formed a subtle mutually beneficial relationship. During the Almoravid conquest of Al-Andalus, Christian kingdoms helped the Taifas defeat their common enemy, and when Christian states fought each other or fell into civil war, Christians would also seek help from Muslim allies."
SEW_ideas_5: "Sole Authority"
SEW_ideas_5_desc: "During the Umayyad era, Abd al-Rahman and his successors Hisham I and Hakam I took a series of measures to promote imperial unity and centralization, deprive local military leaders of their titles, replacing them with their own confidants, weaken local separatist forces, strengthening central authority, and establishing a government management system similar to the Abbasids. Even though the Caliphate of Córdoba has fallen, we still inherit the original centralized system. Seville quickly transitioned from rule by a triumvirate to hereditary monarchical rule. The Emir selects trusted individuals from among his ministers to serve as 'Hajib,' managing royal affairs and even military power, while also establishing viziers and secretariats to assist the Emir in governing the country. This centralized system ensures effective rule over the nation."
SEW_ideas_6: "Remember the Shame of the Almoravids"
SEW_ideas_6_desc: "If our army were strong enough, how could we have fallen to such a state? The Almoravid invasion has become an enduring pain and shame for us. We do not know when the next enemy will come, but to prevent further humiliation, we must strengthen our army's training!"
SEW_ideas_7: "Arab Connections"
SEW_ideas_7_desc: "In the centuries since Tariq first crossed the strait and set foot on the land of Al-Andalus in 711, countless Berbers and Arabs from Yemen, the Levant, Egypt, and other places have poured into Al-Andalus, bringing diverse cultures, ideas, and technologies. Although the population of Al-Andalus remains predominantly native, Islam and Arab culture provide a common identity. Through this identity, we can dismantle the influence of tribal clans and continuously integrate various ethnic groups into the ruling order. Although the once-dominant Syrian elite has declined, Arab culture has become more deeply rooted through conquerors marrying local women and absorbing local families into their lineage and culture. Local nobles learn Arabic and immerse themselves in Arab-Islamic culture, pursuing common goals."

SEW_ideas2_1_desc: "Ah, revenge - sweet revenge. The Abbadids have claimed their bittersweet vengeance, drinking their enemies' blood like fine wine, savoring that tangy bitterness on their tongues. The age of traitors has ended, and Al-Andalus rises again. But what remains after vengeance? When rage and pleasure fade, only a war-torn land and a cycle of hatred remain. So what remains? The victors of Al-Andalus look inward, only to find emptiness."

SEW_ideas2_2: "Port of Seville"
SEW_ideas2_2_desc: "Seville, Al-Andalus' second city, lies amid lush farmlands, growing ever more prosperous. It serves as a hub for regional agricultural goods while the Guadalquivir River grants it a commercial port linking east to the capital and west to the Atlantic. Muslim and Christian merchants trade slaves and goods between emirates, while Jewish Radhanite merchants dominate long-distance trade, funneling Mediterranean, Eastern European, even Indian and Chinese goods through Seville into Al-Andalus. Neither Viking raids nor civil wars could dim Seville's wealth and splendor."

SEW_ideas2_3: "Remembering the Caliphate"
SEW_ideas2_3_desc: "Since the death of Hisham III, last orthodox Caliph of Córdoba, the Taifa kingdoms have become pale shadows of the former Caliphate. The Caliphate was never formally abolished, yet none care. Umayyad and Hammudid claimants still proclaim themselves Caliphs. Many Taifa rulers maintain the fiction of Umayyad authority - by pretending to rule as a ghost Caliph's deputies, their legitimacy goes unchallenged."

SEW_ideas2_7: "Arab Connections"
SEW_ideas2_7_desc: "Since Tariq first crossed the straits in 711, centuries of Berber and Arab migration from Yemen, the Levant and Egypt have enriched Al-Andalus with diverse cultures, ideas and technologies. Though natives remain the majority, Islam and Arab culture provide a shared identity that weakens tribal bonds and integrates peoples into our order. While Syrian elites have declined, Arab culture took deeper root through conquerors wedding local women and absorbing regional families into their lineages. Native nobles learn Arabic, immerse in Arabo-Islamic culture, and pursue common goals."

TLT_ideas_1: "Last Scion"
TLT_ideas_1_desc: "The Umayyads... inheritors of the Prophet and the Rashidun Caliphs' legacy, built a vast empire that reached its zenith. Yet that glory was extinguished in brutal political strife, with massacre survivors fleeing to Iberia to grasp at fading embers. We are the last Umayyad bloodline - a lone boat adrift between eras on seas of uncertainty. Now Christians advance from the north while Muslims tear themselves apart. In these dire times, we must take charge. As the final Umayyads, we wield legitimacy as our weapon. Perhaps we can unite the lost Muslims - then who knows what may come?"

TLT_ideas_2: "Interwoven Faiths"
TLT_ideas_2_desc: "Tulaytula, the 'City of Three Cultures' where religions converge, stands as holy ground. Different paths lead to the same truth. As Umayyad heirs, we respect all faiths. Through successive religious waves, Tulaytula absorbed the best of each, forging unique coexistence. When faiths intertwine, enemies become fellow believers, easing our rule."

TLT_ideas_3: "Unending Strife"
TLT_ideas_3_desc: "Tulaytula stands as the bulwark against the Reconquista, yet receives no Taifa solidarity - only civil wars. Crusaders gnaw at our borders, subjects question our legitimacy, and Taifas fight among themselves. But hardship forges strength - our battle-hardened troops stand ready. We live by war, facing death to end conflict and secure our lands."

TLT_ideas_4: "Celestial Throne"
TLT_ideas_4_desc: "We are the Umayyad bloodline - true Caliphal heirs. When we ascend the dais as 'Umayyad Caliph', slanders die. Rumormongers prostrate themselves; rebels scatter. The Umayyad name shall soar again, terrifying foes. Our dreams reach beyond Iberia - we will reclaim Damascus and restore the empire. When ancestral glory is revived, who cares for hollow titles?"

TLT_ideas_5: "Changing Tides"
TLT_ideas_5_desc: "Muslims reminisce when Umayyad domains stretched to Central Asia and the Atlantic, when Baghdad led the world. But centuries passed. Under Crusader assaults, Islamic lands shrank, even Jerusalem was lost. Now the tide turns - our era dawns. We heal old wounds, end compromises, and strike the arrogant. Under the Umayyad banner, Muslims unite awaiting victory."

TLT_ideas_6: "Silent Stars"
TLT_ideas_6_desc: "The Umayyads built an empire of knowledge. The crescent symbolizes Islam; stars guided Arab astronomers. That empire fell, its wisdom gathering dust in the House of Wisdom. In Iberia, our culture flourished anew in Córdoba, then declined with the Taifas. Gazing at mute stars, we understand - only united under Umayyads can we triumph."

TLT_ideas_7: "Light in Darkness"
TLT_ideas_7_desc: "'The Umayyad era ended long ago,' scholars lament in cramped halls. What can self-proclaimed heirs achieve in Tulaytula's corner? Unifying Iberia seems impossible; expansion unimaginable. Yet we retain assets - the Umayyad legacy, an invincible army. As fortunes shift, our vision unfolds. Though the road remains hard, dawn follows the longest night. We'll prove ourselves worthy of the Umayyad name."

The overconfident Crusaders have receded from Iberia like the tide, and freed Muslims glimpse again that glorious past. What was once our weapon of legitimacy now legitimizes our newborn empire - the Umayyad name shines anew. We need not reminisce about past glory, for we are that legacy incarnate. But our journey has just begun - having risen from the Sunset Land, we must return triumphant to our ancestral home. Let enemies fear, let enemies kneel - we are both last scions of the old era and pioneers of the new."

TLT_ideas2_2: "Interwoven Faiths"
TLT_ideas2_2_desc: "Córdoba, former capital of the Neo-Umayyads. Here stood Europe's first university; here Eastern and Western cultures merged, creating a Mediterranean-Middle Eastern cultural center rivaling Baghdad and Constantinople. The Umayyad restoration is dawn's first light after long darkness, showing war-weary people how faiths may coexist. With Iberia reclaimed, our tolerant policies spread far. Religious persecution ends, and like-minded souls join our court. Through interwoven faiths, governance eases and culture blossoms - harmony in diversity, beauty in unity."

TLT_ideas2_3: "Resurgent Conflict"
TLT_ideas2_3_desc: "Iberia's reconquest ends. War horns still seem to echo across the land as gentle winds bid farewell to departed souls. The living lay down blood-crusted swords, taking up pens to record this peninsula's rebirth. Doubts, conflicts, hatreds, schemes - whether from allied Taifas or sworn enemies - all fade into memory with unification. But looking beyond Iberia, we see strife never ceased. 'To stop war with war, to cease arms with arms' - this was our chosen path, and shall remain our creed. We draw swords again, pointing beyond the peninsula - not for survival now, but to end unending strife."

TLT_ideas2_6: "Silent Stars"
TLT_ideas2_6_desc: "Stars and moon stay silent - we do not. Under Umayyad leadership, Muslims united to defend their homes. Thus endings became beginnings; thorny paths became flowered roads. Umayyad descendants rediscover ancestral wisdom, making culture and science their new mission. Veterans eagerly join reconstruction - observatories, schools, and bookshops rise from ruins, witnessing cultural renaissance. Where we once gazed helplessly at stars, we now explore galaxies through telescopes in peace. Distant stars remind us to focus on the present. We arm ourselves and march eastward - though celestial bodies stay silent, Muslims yearning for liberation surely gaze at these same stars."

TLT_ideas2_7: "Grand Vision"
TLT_ideas2_7_desc: "We've taken the true first step. With the last fortress fallen, Iberia's era of unity dawns. Freed from endless wars, we finally revive Umayyad glory. The restored University of Córdoba again becomes Iberia's and the Mediterranean's academic center, attracting scholars of all faiths. Our fleets sail toward unknown oceans. Bustling cities thrive in peace's light as people witness the empire's rebirth. With strong armies and full granaries, our grand military parade shakes Europe, declaring our ambitions. The weak pity themselves; the strong grow stronger. Our grand vision unfolds - the crescent banner shall fly again over Umayyad lands."

TLT_ideas3_1: "Usurper's Warning"
TLT_ideas3_1_desc: "Umayyad... both unifying banner and our curse. The truth is out - we're impostor scions, legacy of liars and the vain. In this city of three faiths, we betrayed Allah's teachings, propping up dawn with deceit. Broken swords litter bloodied lands where restless demons devour guilty souls on celestial thrones. Times change; the cracked crystal ball's prophecy fulfills as the usurper's kingdom burns, heirs trapped in lies' endless cycle. \"§RUsurper. The celestial throne was never yours. Your kingdom shall be cursed, your soul damned...§!\" The sinner wakes from nightmares - dawn light comes, yet stars stay silent. But with our grand vision unfolding, shall newborn kingdoms halt for dreams? By the window, the sun rises - the sinner's judgment never came.\n\n\"I am the Umayyad Caliph, and my realm is that glorious era reborn.\" He has become history."

Our soldiers are well-trained, and our sailors are brave and daring. On the vast ocean, no enemy can escape our pursuit, and no fleet can defeat our cannons. The billowing sails are our wings on the sea, and the howling winds push us toward victory and glory."

We are the Arab Imperial Navy, led by the glorious imperial admiral."
ML1_ideas_5: "Setting Sail Again"

We instill fear in our enemies, and our plundering and conquest know no end, bringing destruction to our foes, whether on sea or land."

ML2_ideas_4_desc: "Our remarkable ancestors once crossed vast seas in search of unknown lands, and legends even speak of them discovering a new world, most famously Vinland. As Norse culture declined, so too did the legacy of the Norse people fade into obscurity. However, we will not forget, for these memories are ingrained in our blood, inspiring generations of Norse to take to the seas, inheriting the legacy and mission of our ancestors."
ML2_ideas_5: "Religious Freedom"
ML2_ideas_5_desc: "Ibiza lies at the crossroads of multiple religions. Unlike radical Christianity, we respect different faiths and allow them to live on our lands. Whether monotheistic or polytheistic, whether they praise Allah or Jehovah, all can find a place in the Viking strongholds."
ML2_ideas_6: "Journey Home"

The power Odin bestowed upon us far surpasses that of the Christians who have forsaken their roots. This drive will carry us across the seas to reclaim all our ancestral lands.

The wrath of Odin will shatter the Christians' arrogance and restore the glory of the gods."

The shadow of war still looms over the fragmented lands of the former empire, but now we have emerged from chaos, regrouped, and are ready to reclaim our legacy.

These insightful and learned individuals, through the establishment of orders and communities, have educated the once-ignorant Turks, deepening our understanding of Allah and the soul."
SEL_ideas_4: "Zeal of the Convert"
SEL_ideas_4_desc: "Devotion to Allah was one of the key factors in our past expansion. Our faith was once diverse and fragmented, unable to unite under a single banner of truth. However, on the Ughuz steppe, we accepted the truth taught by Arab and Persian clerics, and from there we marched westward, establishing an empire stretching from Mesopotamia to Transoxiana. We follow the teachings of the Prophet, spreading the gospel of Allah to the world, as we have always done, both in the past and now."
SEL_ideas_5: "Call of the Ghazi Warriors"

Formerly lowly wanderers, the unemployed, and thieves gathered under the banner of the one true God. As a fanatical army, they dealt heavy blows to the enemies of the empire and the surrounding infidels, forcing them to either submit to the word of Allah or face utter destruction."
SEL_ideas_6: "Turkic Army"

It was not until the arrival of the Crusaders—these Latins from the distant Western world who destroyed the Byzantine Empire, a symbol of corruption and decay that refused to submit to the Pope—that we were given a new truth. Thus, the Rum Turks gained a fresh start and steadfastly spread and protected the gospel of Christ."

Whether our former Turkic brothers or the Muslims occupying the Levant and Persia, if they cannot be enlightened by the supreme teachings of Christ, then we must conquer these stubborn infidels using the methods of the Crusaders. In any case, the glory of the Lord must shine over every inch of the former empire."

Later, they followed the footsteps of the Great Seljuk Empire to migrate to Persia and Khorasan. Now, though we are in the heart of Anatolia, we have never forgotten the glorious traditions of our ancestors. Powerful and mobile cavalry remain the main force of our army."

SAN_ideas_1_desc: "The empire and the Pope's united Crusade destroyed the once-glorious empire, leaving only puppet emperors and a divided carcass. The people of Constantinople fled in all directions, and ambitious nobles watched like wolves. The world only knows that the noble imperial lineage has perished, that the splendid palaces have fallen into dust; they only know that the traitor who invited the wolves has been punished, that the Pope's puppet has extended his grace. But Rome has never perished, Rome will never perish! The blood of the Komnenos family flows in our veins, we are the remnants of the Romans who wrote a thousand years of epic history, and we are... the last Romans. The road to restoring the Roman Empire is long and arduous, but our ancestors also started from Rome and eventually became the masters of the Mediterranean. We too will start from Macedonia and trace the great achievements of our ancestors. The glorious mandate of heaven rests upon us. On the road to the dream of restoring Rome, our ancestors have left us more than enough."

The Romans conquered this land, and Greek culture conquered Rome, bringing prosperity to Greco-Roman culture. Emperor Constantine established his capital in Constantinople, and thus the center of the Roman Empire shifted to the Greek cultural region. Now, the divine land has fallen, and heroes rise, all seeking to establish their own dominance over Greece. We hold the starting point of Alexander's empire and have inherited the lost Roman legacy of a hundred years; we will surely save Greece from the hands of tyrants and false emperors, we are the saviors of all Greece! The legacy of Rome has blessed future generations. The people of Greece have not forgotten the strength and prosperity of the Roman Empire, its grace and protection, and the people who hold fast to Greek culture are eagerly waiting for someone to shatter their chains. Our fellow Roman remnants eagerly join our army and forge ahead toward the glorious ideal of liberating Greece. 'Savior of Greece, you will return like lightning.'"

Now that the empire has suddenly fallen, numerous powers have risen, each seeking to establish dominance over Greece.

We are the saviors of all Greece! The legacy of Rome has blessed future generations. The people of Greece have not forgotten the strength, prosperity, grace, and protection of the Roman Empire.

SAN_ideas_3: "The Unfinished Imperial Dream"
SAN_ideas_3_desc: "The age of Justinian has long passed, and Rome's control over North Africa and the Balkans has vanished with the Arab conquests. The dream of restoring the empire was shattered by a civil war among the Crusaders. Our imperial dream came to an abrupt halt, and we have been lying low for over two hundred years. However, dreams never cease. Even the quietest woods have rustling sounds, and the calmest waters have undercurrents. Times have changed. Europe today is our stage. The Roman remnants, who have been in decline for over two hundred years, have reunited under our banner, and now is the perfect time for us to restore the empire. The mandate of heaven is eternal. To reshape the dark and corrupt order of Europe, to rebuild the great and glorious Roman Empire, to revive the brilliant Roman civilization—this is the unfinished dream of our ancestors for thousands of years, this is the great imperial dream we are destined to achieve."

However, how can the weak puppets of the Pope stop the tide of our restoration? The sparks of rebellion in the Latin pseudo-empire have spread like wildfire, and the false emperors are too busy to care. This heaven-sent opportunity is not something we, who are content with a corner, will miss. The rebel forces are strong but trapped, and without guidance, they are nothing but a cornered beast. We rise from below, but our strength is weak and our name unknown. Without external support, we would only bring shame upon ourselves. But now we have made contact with these Roman remnants and assured them of external support and unified command, and they are happy to provide information about these unstable puppet states—as bargaining chips for our war negotiations. We are rebellious restorers, we are the unyielding Romans!"

We have lain low for over two hundred years, and now the time has come. New and old grudges will be settled! The Roman remnants welcome us with open arms, while the traitorous scum flee in panic, utterly defeated. Now people rally to us, seeing us as the Third Rome... but the culprits still live in debauchery, and who remembers the crimes of a hundred years ago? But we remember, we will always remember this great shame! We draw our swords, we take revenge, we swear to personally behead the traitorous Roman patriarch and his accomplices, to comfort the spirits of our ancestors."
SAN_ideas_6: "The Final Judgment"
SAN_ideas_6_desc: "The once-united Catholics have turned against each other, and the self-righteous Crusader states have become corrupt and decadent. The Roman patriarch, he resists the Lord, exalts himself, and claims to be 'God'; he wields the authority granted by God, issuing orders and oppressing the people. Fellow Christians suffer oppression, the people live in misery, and evil runs rampant. The biblical prophecy of the end times is upon us, and the final judgment has arrived. Then, 'the corrupt who bring disaster will perish, the suffering saints will ascend to heaven, the loving Christ will return, the faithful will rise again, and a thousand years of holy rule will begin.' We follow the true faith, we act for justice. Those antichrists think they can suppress us and avoid judgment, escaping eternal punishment. But the miracles of Christ have already appeared, and the time of the final judgment has never been delayed. We will carry out the final judgment, spread the gospel far and wide, and create a millennium of good governance."

MGB_ideas_5: "Saharan Caravans"

Caravans would rest in the Maghreb and Sahel regions before continuing their journey, often seeking Berbers as guides. Now that we control the entire Maghreb, this trans-Saharan trade route will undoubtedly fall into our hands, bringing endless wealth to the federation."

Politicians, generals, marshals—their grand visions to save this great nation all vanished silently in the smoke. The era of monarchy has long fallen silent, and only the merchant ships still strive to recall the glory of this once-great nation."
EN3_ideas_2: "Trade Expeditions"
EN3_ideas_2_desc: "Under the pressure of the expanding forces on the British Isles, more and more people are leaving their precarious homelands. They set sail, they embark. With a slight hope for wealth and the future, they step onto the path of the unknown. They await the vast ocean to give its answer—waiting, hoping."
EN3_ideas_3: "Monopoly Act"
EN3_ideas_3_desc: "After the long and protracted war, the nearly collapsed finances and precarious situation urgently demanded that England accumulate wealth rapidly through trade to maintain its independence and stability. Thus, England's Monopoly Act was enacted, stipulating that only Englishmen could engage in trade within England. The introduction of this law symbolized the English government's complete break with the past—wealth has now become the sharpest sword in the hands of the English."
EN3_ideas_4: "Issuing Letters of Marque"
EN3_ideas_4_desc: "The English lost their once-proud navy in that great war. At Calais, dozens of warships were scuttled. But the indomitable English always find a way—the Five Provinces Alliance began issuing letters of marque in a semi-public manner, gradually forming a structured and organized force of pirates. From then on, the English were no longer satisfied with mere trade—the ocean is always mysterious, and no one knows when the storm will come."
EN3_ideas_5: "Industrial Prosperity"

High profits, a relaxed environment, and the government's overt and covert support have led to the rapid development of English overseas investments. By transfusing the inland with overseas territories, using cheap resources to reduce production costs, and exporting high-priced products, we reap enormous profits—thus, a new and unforeseen world, a hegemonic system, is gradually revealing its dawn."

Though we may no longer be the fearsome force that once shook Europe, the memory of our conquering past remains deeply etched in the minds of every Norseman. We will not be worn down by the passage of time, and the vast river of history will forever bear our mark, recording our conquests!"
NSE_ideas_2: "Setting Sail"

They settled here, naming it 'Vera Cruz,' and erected a large cross to declare our sovereignty. Thus, the holy cross crossed vast distances to reach this hopeful shore. After reporting this good news, the lords of the Old World and the Pope granted this land to the steadfast and fortunate adventurers as a frontier for the New World. Those weary of conflict and war followed our footsteps, stepping into the unknown world, joining the construction of the New World."
HCR_ideas_2: "Civilizing Mission"
HCR_ideas_2_desc: "The calm sea glistens, no longer the turbulent and perilous waters of our voyage. Yet our dreams have not sunk; the mission we received before departure remains unchanged. We have forged a link between the old and the new, fulfilling the long-held dream of sailing overseas. But the primitive tribes here remain unenlightened, not yet blessed by the Christian God. We are both a haven for travelers and an extension of the Christian world. The missionaries who accompanied us have integrated with the local natives, and those baptized now support our cause. Our path to civilization is bright. But no matter what, we will not forget: we came from the old Christian world, and we are destined to return to our civilizing mission."
HCR_ideas_3: "People First"
HCR_ideas_3_desc: "We sailed from the distant Old World, breaking through the shackles of the ocean, to erect a grand cross on this new continent and claim our sovereignty over this land. Although we have initially established friendly relations with the local natives and have taken root here through conquest and assimilation, a lone boat, who controls its fate? Strong neighbors surround us beyond our control, and internal strife still requires time to prove. This is precisely why we need more hands to help us consolidate our overseas endeavors. In the process of building settlements, we have learned the importance of putting people first. With the support of policies encouraging childbirth and aid from the Old World, our population of military age has expanded, and they have brought us hard-earned peace. Preserve the people, and the land will be preserved; preserve the land but lose the people, and both will be lost."

HCR_ideas_4: "Utopia"
HCR_ideas_4_desc: "The Reconquista, the Muslim uprisings, the division between the Empire and the Church... all of these have left the people of the Old World physically and mentally exhausted, so some of them voluntarily joined the pioneering knightly orders and became the first to arrive here. As time passed, even the most barren cliffs eventually saw sturdy pines standing tall, and even the most backward places could become utopias, this is our 'Veracruz'. With absolute victory, we have undoubtedly established a firm foothold here; and under the strategy of combining grace and power, the surrounding tribes have joined and been baptized one after another. Peace has brought development, and communication has promoted integration. Peace has allowed our people to focus on production, and the combination of local production methods with Old World technology has burst out with new vitality. Material abundance has brought poetry and distant horizons, ushering in a serene and stable era. 'Here lies peace and happiness, with no desire to return.'"

HCR_ideas_5: "Loose Governance"
HCR_ideas_5_desc: "Governing a diverse nation requires not only sufficient strength but also a relatively relaxed environment—or perhaps the wisdom of decentralization. Thanks to the court experiences brought by predecessors from the Old World, they nominally placed the subjugated tribes under the rule of the knightly order while allowing their chieftains to adapt to local conditions. They also encouraged immigrants to respect the customs of the natives and established a society where natives and immigrants coexisted, using time to dissolve the differences among the people. Although immigrants and natives have gradually become indistinguishable today, the tradition of loose governance remains, transformed through evolution. After exploring the appropriate boundaries, our governance system not only demonstrates the authority of the central government but also greatly mobilizes local enthusiasm. And this is the charm of loose governance."

HCR_ideas_6: "Land of Redwood"
HCR_ideas_6_desc: "When we first arrived here, we were curious about the red-colored wood, but once we realized its excellence, unseen in the Old World, it became our cheapest and most durable building material. This wood is abundant here, with a uniform structure, heavy and hard texture, and good moisture resistance, providing great convenience for our initial settlement. After incorporating the styles of local native architecture, we not only saved labor but also reduced costs, establishing a unique architectural standard for the Holy Cross Land. If the cross provided spiritual support for our pioneering, then undoubtedly, the abundant redwood resources were our material pillar."

HCR_ideas_7: "New World, New Opportunities"

'The sea is there,' and after breaking free from the chains of the Old World, what remains for us is a sky and ocean free of gunpowder smoke. The new world symbolizes new opportunities, and new people write new chapters. Exotic goods from the New World are continuously sent back to the Old World, and high profits encourage us to map even more distant places. The prosperity of commerce brings new ecosystems, and a life of abundance gives rise to new ideas: thus, poetry flourishes in the wilderness, and literature thrives in all directions. No one questions our pioneering status anymore; we are the trendsetters of the era. Who can match our brilliance in the vast ocean?"

Initially, Aragon stood alone and weak—but today, the Aragonese are well-connected and versatile. To our powerful neighbors, we show weakness; to distant allies, we sing praises. It is under such flexible and pragmatic diplomatic thinking that our kingdom maintains neutrality and contributes to the great cause of the Reconquista. Our monarch is the most adept diplomat on the Iberian Peninsula, and after generations of effort, the high reputation of our kingdom is unquestionable."

# DD_ARA_ideas_1_desc: "The Kingdom of Aragon is sandwiched between the powerful Kingdom of Asturias and the Kingdom of France, forcing Aragonese rulers to navigate diplomatically and contribute to the Reconquista to maintain neutrality while avoiding influence from both nations.

The Aragonese royal family understands this well, but due to the necessity of survival amidst powerful neighbors, they can only slightly alleviate the peasants' burdens. Though the peasants may be momentarily excited and work hard, they soon realize that taxes remain heavy, and the stars above remain distant. When the protectors of the peasants can no longer effectively shield their people, what will happen next..."
# DD_ARA_ideas_2_desc: "The peasants in the Catalonia region have long suffered under heavy taxation. Fortunately, the Aragonese royal family is kind-hearted and will protect these peasants... or will they?"
DD_ARA_ideas_3: "Maritime Council"
DD_ARA_ideas_3_desc: "Though we lack the bustling trade alliances of Genoa and Venice, nor do we control the strategic chokehold of Gibraltar like the infidels or Africa, Barcelona still holds a place in the Mediterranean trade system. Merchants gather, goods are distributed; though small and weak, we are fortunate to integrate into a corner of Mediterranean commerce. Thus, we established the Maritime Council—a quasi-judicial body to enforce maritime and commercial laws. This was a transaction of necessity: we conveyed the royal family's intention to no longer interfere with the caravans, and in return, they provided us with wealth—and indeed, our caravans did not disappoint, bringing us a steady stream of riches."
# DD_ARA_ideas_3_desc: "The Maritime Council is our newly established quasi-judicial body responsible for enforcing maritime and commercial laws. This ensures our merchants are free from royal interference in commercial disputes, while the Aragonese crown receives financial support from the merchants in return."
DD_ARA_ideas_4: "Legacy of the Reconquista"
DD_ARA_ideas_4_desc: "Our nation was born from the process of expelling the Arabs, undoubtedly sharing in the great cause of the Reconquista alongside Asturias. Yet, we are small and our voices weak, further removed from the frontlines of war, and even unwelcome among our own brethren. But we will not forget our mission, nor will we abandon it. Under a flexible and pragmatic foreign policy, our negotiators are equally adept in their tasks. Though we cannot directly defeat our enemies on the battlefield, we can still undermine the foundations of Muslim rule from the shadows. However, our diplomats act with caution—for only a unified Iberia can see the dawn of light and liberation."
# DD_ARA_ideas_4_desc: "dddd"
DD_ARA_ideas_5: "Latin Heritage"
DD_ARA_ideas_5_desc: "We are the starting point of the Roman Empire in Iberia, and the southern frontier established by the Franks. We are undoubtedly the most Latinized in Iberia, a nation with Latin traditions. Yet, due to our weakness, we have been confined to a corner, never able to revive the Latinization of Iberia. Now, the situation has changed, and in this era of great contention, we too have the opportunity to make our mark. Though the days of Rome and the Franks are gone, we are confident in once again pushing the wave of Latinization across all of Iberia. And with the operation of our propaganda machine, this is gradually becoming feasible."
# DD_ARA_ideas_5_desc: "As one of the highly Latinized provinces of the Roman Empire and later the southern march established by the Franks, Aragon has always been a nation with Latin traditions. With the current diversity of languages and religions in Spain, perhaps it is time to promote a unified Latin language."
DD_ARA_ideas_6: "Silk Committee"
DD_ARA_ideas_6_desc: "Silk from the East is deeply cherished by the nobility. Whether coming from North Africa or westward through Constantinople-Italy, Barcelona in Aragon is undoubtedly the hub of the silk trade. Though a small nation, this is undoubtedly a divine opportunity. Thus, we established the Silk Committee to regulate the national silk trade. The regulation of the silk trade has helped stabilize domestic commerce, and in coordination with the Maritime Council, the two have provided us with substantial financial support. The developing silk market has attracted foreign technology, reducing the cost of expanding our communities and production."
# DD_ARA_ideas_6_desc: "Silk trade is common in major Aragonese cities such as Barcelona and Valencia. To better regulate production, manage silk trade, and extract wealth, Aragon has established a Silk Committee to oversee silk transactions."
DD_ARA_ideas_7: "The Aragonese Prince"
DD_ARA_ideas_7_desc: "In the court of Barcelona, ministers from two factions argue incessantly; and sometimes, fate forces you to make a choice. The Prince of Aragon is weary of such endless debates, yet he has not found his answer: should he trace the dreams of his ancestors and revive the cause of the conquerors, or should he withdraw to a distant place, returning to the destined land of his dreams... At least for now, it is not yet time to make a choice. So, in this precious moment of respite, let us consider carefully."
# DD_ARA_ideas_7_desc: "Initially, the Aragonese prince grew weary of convoluted diplomacy. He craved an answer. Should he devote himself to his ancestors' dreams? Or step away to pursue something greater? This decision had to be made by himself."

DD_ARA_ideas3_1: "Politics in the Cracks"
DD_ARA_ideas3_1_desc: "The people of the Iberian Peninsula never imagined they would come this far in such a manner. The threats of Asturias and the era of the Reconquista are now history, and the adept leaders must face a new future. A fragmented France, a hesitant Holy Roman Empire, a war-torn Africa—our former foes are now the stage for our grand ambitions. Allying with the distant and attacking the near, quelling chaos and exploiting crises, bribing openly... In the interplay of light and shadow, the monarch of the united kingdom looks down upon the world, treating neighboring nations as playthings. Our kingdom's might is felt across the seas, its fame spread far and wide—who says that in the cracks, one cannot find the art of diplomacy?"

DD_ARA_ideas2_2: "Protector of the Peasants"
DD_ARA_ideas2_2_desc: "Water can carry a boat, but it can also overturn it. Yet, the bloody sunset adorns the crimson cross, and the peasants put away their tools and shattered dreams, returning to a cold and tragic reality. However, a brief outburst shattered the facade of peace, and the nation, restored to order, reignited the winds of change for the once-impotent royal family. No longer worried about powerful neighbors, the king overruled all opposition, showing his sincerity and determination to reform for the kingdom's most suffering peasants. Taxes are no longer heavy, and the peasants now open their eyes to the warm sunlight streaming through their windows. Today's royal family is the true protector of the peasants—when the 'highest' and the 'lowest' are united in heart and mind, true 'unity' is achieved."

DD_ARA_ideas3_3: "Maritime Council"
DD_ARA_ideas3_3_desc: "The great fish folds its fins, stirring the waters for a thousand miles; the roc folds its wings, soaring to the heavens. The throat of the Mediterranean is now in our grasp, and the wealth from the New World has shattered the monopoly of the Italian financiers. We are no longer a timid, insignificant nation, but a united Western power with ambitions in all directions. And this is all thanks to the Maritime Council. Now, we have strengthened its functions and added new weight to our dealings with merchants. Backed by strong national power, the caravans follow our lead, willingly trading their wealth for royal protection. And the trade of the entire Western Mediterranean easily falls into our hands—as it should."

DD_ARA_ideas2_4: "Legacy of the Reconquista"
DD_ARA_ideas2_4_desc: "The great cause of the Reconquista has concluded, and the past grudges are but a wisp of smoke. On the ruins of Iberia, the sole victor gazes at the boundless ocean; the rising sun heralds a new dawn, and the distant sound of bagpipes heralds the peninsula's rebirth. The so-called Reconquista is but a cycle from one conquest to the next. Yet, the lessons of the past have become new knowledge, guiding our path forward. Our diplomats, with their accumulated experience, continue to maneuver on the international stage, maximizing our nation's interests. Rowing against the current, we must advance or retreat. And the banner of the Reconquista will forever guide us, as we cut through thorns towards the stars and the sea—time flows like a river, unceasing day and night."

DD_ARA_ideas3_5: "Latin Heritage"
DD_ARA_ideas3_5_desc: "Our Iberia, Latinized Iberia—our century-old dream has finally become reality. Now, Iberia is unified, and we can finally begin the process of Latinization. Today's Iberia is a place of religious chaos and linguistic diversity. Chaotic religious beliefs threaten the stability of the kingdom, and diverse languages hinder communication and exchange across regions. But the era of unified Latinization will come. Unifying religion, promoting Latin... If in the past we conquered and unified Iberia through diplomacy and military might, now we are conquering it culturally."

DD_ARA_ideas2_6: "Silk Committee"
DD_ARA_ideas2_6_desc: "The Valencia Silk Exchange—this magnificent Gothic structure witnessed the golden age of the Iberian silk trade: silk from the East, arriving via the New World and new sea routes, gathered here and was continuously sold to the nobility across Europe. Gold and silver flowed into our coffers, while the merchants of Venice and Genoa mourned, trapped in trade decline and financial crises. Caravans came and went, ships arrived in droves, the people lived in peace, and communities prospered. Technology and craftsmen gathered here, providing considerable convenience for our community governance. Without silk, where would we be today?"
DD_ARA_ideas2_7: "The Aragonese Prince"
DD_ARA_ideas2_7_desc: "Iberia is reunified, and the wave of the Reconquista seems to have receded—yet the prince still recalls the aspirations of his ancestors, dreaming of the dark ages brought by the Muslims. The lands of the Reconquista remain unsubdued, and the path of Saint James is thorny. He sees a nation just emerging from chaos, sees displaced peasants—how can the Prince of Aragon find peace? He dreams of Christ handing him a sword, telling him of the past of the Reconquista and the bright future he must achieve with this sword. The Prince of Aragon coldly observes the arguments of the two factions below, draws his sword, cuts the table, and makes his choice. 'I am a child of Iberia.'"
# DD_ARA_ideas2_7_desc: "In the end, the Aragonese prince chose to stand firmly with the people of the peninsula, inheriting the legacy of the Reconquista, continuing the ancient dreams of his ancestors, reclaiming the land of Saint James, and securing glory for himself for generations to come."
DD_ARA_ideas3_7: "The Aragonese Prince"
DD_ARA_ideas3_7_desc: "Our blood flows with the heritage of the Latins. The glorious days of the Franks have turned into decadent revelry, and the great history of the Roman Empire is left with nothing but puppet emperors. We were once their southern frontier, the starting point of their conquest of the peninsula, but today, we have achieved the unification of Iberia and once again accomplished the great feat of Latinization. Perhaps now, we can once again recreate the great achievements of the Franks and Romans, establishing a universal empire of the Latins. The Prince of Aragon pulls off the tablecloth, unabashedly displaying his longing for Latin culture, and makes his choice. 'I am a descendant of the Latin people.'"
# DD_ARA_ideas3_7_desc: "Finally, the Aragonese prince pulled off the tablecloth, unabashedly expressing his admiration for Latin culture, claiming the lands of France, guiding prosperous trade, and promoting a glorious heritage, which will also bring honor to him for generations to come."

DD_SP9_ideas_start: "Iberian Traditions"
DD_SP9_ideas_bonus: "Iberian Ambition"
SP9_ideas_7: "Chivalry"
SP9_ideas_7_desc: "Humility, honor, sacrifice, valor, compassion, honesty, justice, spirituality - these are the eight knightly virtues. Martial spirit, loyalty to sovereign, righteous deeds, and exceptional wisdom... these too they pursue lifelong. In lands once fallen, endless conflicts raged. Yet through civil wars and foreign invasions, our proud chivalric tradition endured, now shining brighter than ever in reunified Iberia. Where pessimists declared the end of Iberian knighthood, we proclaim its glorious revival. Tournaments resume before packed crowds in long-abandoned arenas. Knights stand ready, marching toward noble ideals, blades bared.\n\"I swear to be faithful to my love until death.\"\n"
SP9_ideas_1: "Land of Knights"
SP9_ideas_1_desc: "Our homeland once fell, yet resistance forces emerged from the cracks. But allied armies lacked unity - the self-styled 'Emperor of All Spain' couldn't manage his own house, while Navarrese and Aragonese kings shifted allegiances shamelessly for survival. Africa granted us a second chance, helping expel infidels to establish a true knightly kingdom in Iberia. Inspired by chivalry, we fear no peril; guided by faith, we strike God's enemies. In this land of resistance, knights organize endlessly, witnessing a new Crusading era's dawn.\n\"Offer courage and faith to the Lord.\"\n"
SP9_ideas_2: "Home of Chivalry"
SP9_ideas_2_desc: "Though hard to admit, the Muslim invasion spurred chivalry's birth. Introduced stirrups birthed new cavalry, transforming Iberian arms. As knightly orders grew, so did chivalric ideals - beacons for knights' striving, and Christendom's priceless spiritual treasure. That Iberia birthed chivalry makes our duty heavier. As its cradle, we cannot lag behind. Our knights eagerly await chances to shine.\n\"Live for dignity and honor.\"\n"
SP9_ideas_3: "Knight Training"
SP9_ideas_3_desc: "The war-torn land revives, yet the knightly homeland lacked chivalry - threatening our standing. Thus we prioritized knightly education. Combining Christian doctrine with martial spirit, we intensified training - only through hardship are true warriors forged. We integrated education into frequent tournaments, letting all witness knights' development. Hard-won scars become battlefield talismans; splintered lances, shields against despair. Through rigorous training, knights' skills reach new heights, proving decisive in combat. Today's knightly orders march unflinching toward death, leaving only terror in their wake - \"Never turn your back on the enemy.\""
SP9_ideas_4: "Armed with New Muskets"
SP9_ideas_4_desc: "Knights face unprecedented challenges. New weapons render their charges less fearsome against gunfire; their archery pales against muskets. In this uncertainty, we found new paths - thus, mounted arquebusiers emerged. Shielded by heavy cavalry, these new units employ Iberian mobile-fire tactics to rupture enemy formations, supporting knightly charges. Those declaring knighthood's end shall kneel before our steel, repenting their words.\n\"Never refuse a challenge from equals.\"\n"
SP9_ideas_5: "Fortress Defense"
SP9_ideas_5_desc: "Knights must lead charges and defend homelands. They have aspirations and people to protect. They are swords for victory, shields for peace. Voluntarily united, they've fortified our strongholds. Centuries of resistance yielded precious defensive experience; unified purpose perfects strategies. Our bastions stand impregnable - before united knights, the fiercest assaults crumble, the direst situations reverse.\n\"Protect the weak and helpless.\"\n"
SP9_ideas_6: "The Last Knight"
SP9_ideas_6_desc: "The Renaissance, Reformation, Crusades' ebb, new weapons... Amid humanist revival, we withstand theological critiques. As holy war tides recede, the Crusading era inevitably ends. Firearms threaten our mobility, turning proud knightly dreams to gunsmoke dust. We are the old era's remnants, yet steam's distant roar approaches with the tide... We are the last knights. As sunset gilds their armor, moonlight will reveal their stubborn devotion. Horns sound their final charge - minstrels, stay and sing until the new age's winds scatter them to dust."

DD_FEZ_ideas: "Fez Ideas"
DD_FEZ_ideas_start: "Fez Traditions"
DD_FEZ_ideas_bonus: "Fez Ambition"

DD_FEZ_ideas_1: "Advanced Galleys"
DD_FEZ_ideas_1_desc: "The Crusaders achieved great victories against Muslims. When Muslim power still dominated Europe, our galleys transported Crusaders to North Africa and Syria, winning glorious triumphs. To our former overlords, we were first rulers of Fez, then governors of Africa. Now as Africa falters, to defeat a greater foe we must first sever its maritime connections. Galleys remain our best choice for naval dominance. Our craftsmen improve galley designs while soldiers train relentlessly in galley warfare. The galley's era isn't over - our fleet shall write its most glorious chapter yet."

DD_FEZ_ideas_2: "Between Peaks and Sea"
DD_FEZ_ideas_2_desc: "West lies the endless ocean, east the long Atlas Mountains - within this complex terrain, Fez enjoys natural defenses. During the Crusades, our forces seized this fertile land first. Distance from Africa's political center made direct rule impossible, forcing them to establish us as a viceroyalty. Conquering these lands honed our mountain marching skills, reducing attrition. Now the tides have turned - time to break our chains. An army tempered between peaks and sea shall achieve the impossible against our former masters."

DD_FEZ_ideas_3: "Trade Hub"
DD_FEZ_ideas_3_desc: "Astride trans-Saharan trade routes linking North and West Africa, we remain commercially vital. Once Muslim caravans traded gold, salt and slaves while spreading knowledge westward. Though that golden age passed, the foundation remains. We'll revive trade routes abandoned after Muslim expulsion. Along dusty trails, laden camels herald trade's new dawn. As Europe's gateway to West Africa, experienced caravans provide resources for greater ambitions - how can impoverished Tunisia defeat a wealthy mercantile state?"

DD_FEZ_ideas_4: "Wealth as Weapon"
DD_FEZ_ideas_4_desc: "Favored by geography, we broke free from African rule as an independent viceroyalty. To challenge stronger Africa, we must drain their land forces while disrupting trade. We've secretly harbored infamous Mediterranean privateers, rebranding them to harass enemy shipping. Our overlord's precarious position worsens - this economic warfare achieves strategic reversal without bloodshed."

DD_FEZ_ideas_5: "Desert Riders"
DD_FEZ_ideas_5_desc: "Since Roman times, Mauritanian cavalry earned renown - these desert-born horsemen formed Rome's elite, conquering vast territories. Though Rome fell, the desert riders survived, waiting in silence. We haven't forgotten them. Our envoys sought these proud remnants in the sands, offering glory and power to revive their legacy. Mighty warriors remount, charging for honor and victory - tilting the scales in our favor."

DD_FEZ_ideas_6: "Righteous Rebellion"
DD_FEZ_ideas_6_desc: "Usurpers sit on thrones while the rightful prince, after long wanderings, reached our domain. Though we bear no love for our overlords, heaven-sent opportunities shouldn't be wasted. We shelter the exiled prince, earning Crusader states' praise. Our resistance transforms from regional defiance into righteous revolt. Though neighbors won't aid us, our overlord loses legitimacy, isolated and vulnerable. Having bided our time, we march east - where our banners appear, people will welcome their liberators."

DD_FEZ_ideas_7: "Merchant Ship Expertise"
DD_FEZ_ideas_7_desc: "With eastern routes blocked by mountains, the sea becomes our lifeline. Maritime trade dominates our commerce whether with Iberian Crusader states, our overlord, or Italian merchants. Thus our traders mastered winds and currents, arbitrage, brokerage, and negotiation. Merchant contracts flood in; ships crowd our harbors. Land and sea trade converge here, completing our final advantage against our overlords."

DD_MOT_ideas: "Mauritanian Ideas"
DD_MOT_ideas_start: "Mauritanian Traditions"
DD_MOT_ideas_bonus: "Mauritanian Ambition"

DD_MOT_ideas_1: "Advanced Galleys"
DD_MOT_ideas_1_desc: "The Christians achieved great victories against Muslims in their Crusades. When Muslim influence still dominated the European continent, our galleys had already transported Crusader warriors to North Africa and Syria, achieving glorious victories. To our former suzerain, we were first and foremost rulers of Fez, and only secondarily governors of Africa. Now with Africa embroiled in turmoil, if we wish to defeat a stronger foe, we must first sever its maritime connections with allies, leaving it isolated. Galleys remain our optimal choice for naval dominance. Our craftsmen focus on improving galley quality, while our soldiers train rigorously in galley warfare. The age of galleys is not yet over - our warships shall leave an indelible mark on the glorious history of galleys upon the seas."

DD_MOT_ideas_2: "Between Peaks and Sea"
DD_MOT_ideas_2_desc: "Bordered by the endless ocean to the west and the lengthy Atlas Mountains to the east - within this complex geographical environment, Fez lies protected between natural barriers that are easy to defend but hard to attack. During the Crusades against Muslims, our forces took the lead in entering this land of abundance and opportunity. Being distant from Africa's political center made their rule ineffective, forcing them to establish us as a viceroyalty. Our warriors honed their mountain marching skills during the conquest, significantly reducing attrition. Now the situation has changed - it is the perfect time to emerge from the mountains and break the chains of our former overlord's rule. The army tempered between peaks and sea is destined to achieve immortal feats in this 'david versus goliath' conflict."

DD_MOT_ideas_3: "Trade Hub"
DD_MOT_ideas_3_desc: "Located along one of the trans-Saharan trade routes connecting North Africa to West Africa, we maintain pivotal importance in Saharan trade. In former times, Muslims organized massive caravans trading gold, salt, slaves and other goods along these routes, transmitting knowledge and technology to West Africa. Though that golden age has passed, the foundation remains. We will revive the trade that gradually declined after the Muslim expulsion. Along the dusty sand roads, heavily-laden camels carry the dawn of a new era in trade history. Now positioned as Europe's gateway for goods entering West Africa, our experienced caravans provide the capital for grand ambitions - how could impoverished Tunisia possibly defeat a wealthy trading nation?"

DD_MOT_ideas_4: "Economic Warfare"
DD_MOT_ideas_4_desc: "Benefiting from exceptionally favorable geographical conditions, we successfully separated from African rule, establishing ourselves as an independent viceroyalty. Now to confront the more powerful Africa, we must not only deplete their land forces but also disrupt their economic and trade activities at sea. We have secretly harbored many notorious privateers from the Mediterranean coast, granting them new identities to harass enemy trade routes. Our suzerain's already precarious situation worsens further - this demonstrates the remarkable success of our economic warfare strategy, achieving a reversal of fortunes without deploying a single soldier."

DD_MOT_ideas_5: "Desert Cavalry"
DD_MOT_ideas_5_desc: "Since Roman times, Mauritanian cavalry has enjoyed great renown; in the Roman legions, these desert-bred horsemen formed the main force, earning countless merits in expanding the empire's territories. Though Rome's era has passed, the desert cavalry did not disappear, only lying dormant in the endless sands. We have not forgotten their existence. Our envoys ventured deep into the desert, finding descendants still lost in past glories, and invited them to reclaim their former splendor with promises of merit and power. The valiant warriors have mounted their steeds once more, charging for glory and victory. Thus, the scales of victory tilt further in our favor."

DD_MOT_ideas_6: "Righteous Uprising"
DD_MOT_ideas_6_desc: "Usurpers sit high in their halls, while the rightful prince, after many hardships, finally reached our domain. Though we bear no goodwill toward our suzerain, when heaven grants such an opportunity, how can we not seize it? Thus without hesitation we sheltered the former dynasty's prince, earning widespread acclaim among Crusader states. Now our resistance is no longer framed as a regional rebellion against central authority, but rather as a righteous campaign against usurpers. Though neighboring states won't offer support because of this, our suzerain has lost its legitimacy and stands isolated in desperate straits. Having lain dormant for so long, now is the time for our eastern campaign - for wherever our armies march, the people will joyously welcome their liberators."

DD_MOT_ideas_7: "Merchant Ship Expertise"
DD_MOT_ideas_7_desc: "With eastern routes blocked by mountain ranges, maritime transport has become our most convenient means of external communication. Naturally, sea trade constitutes the major part of our foreign commerce. Whether trading with Iberian Crusader states, our suzerain, or even Italian city-states, merchant ships inevitably play a central role. This is precisely why our maritime traders have accumulated rich experience: utilizing winds and currents, profiting from price differences, acting as intermediaries, commercial negotiations - our sea traders have mastered it all. Consequently, merchant ship contracts arrive in endless succession, while trading vessels flock to our ports. Land and sea trade converge here, completing the final piece that enables us to challenge our suzerain."

 DD_FRA_ideas_1:"Estates General"
 DD_FRA_ideas_1_desc:"As our conflicts with the Empire and its colluding Papacy intensified, coupled with the severe devastation wrought upon the kingdom by years of warfare, when we gazed upon the banks of the Seine a century ago, all we saw and heard were wails and crumbling ruins. The royal authority painstakingly built over generations had waned once more, while debt-ridden finances reached dire straits, forcing the beleaguered monarchy to seek solutions at the brink of catastrophe - thus, the Estates General came into being. As a compromise with the nobility and rising urban class, clergy, nobles, and burghers formed an alliance under royal leadership, uniting to deliberate on state affairs and ultimately helping the kingdom survive the difficult postwar reconstruction. Now we can finally extricate ourselves from myriad affairs to address the vacillating southern dukes and the Channel alliance we previously had no time for, awaiting our heaven-sent opportunity."
 DD_FRA_ideas_2:"Never Again the Tragedy of Poitou"
 DD_FRA_ideas_2_desc:"In the past, the Emperor and his lackeys pieced together their unholy crusade against kin and countrymen, seizing southern lands that were rightfully part of France, and at Poitou, they shattered Capetian rule in France. This resulted not only from our miscalculation of imperial ambition and underhanded methods, but also from our ill-trained, ineffective armies - weaknesses further exposed in subsequent succession wars and campaigns for the five English provinces. Incompetent commanders caused needless casualties through poor tactics, while dispirited troops routed at the first strong resistance. During this century of transition, we intensified military drills and reformed officer selection. Now beneath the banner of vengeance against the Empire, our armies stand united with the bearing of a formidable force - proclaiming that the tragedy of Poitou shall never be repeated."
 DD_FRA_ideas_3:"Lessons of the Magna Carta"
 DD_FRA_ideas_3_desc:"After the disastrous defeat at Poitou, the former English lands once conquered by the glorious Norman dynasty rose in rebellion amidst the chaos, forcing the crumbling kingdom to sign the Magna Carta with the burghers of England, granting the five English provinces substantial autonomy. Yet, every loss brings its own gain. Though the establishment of the Magna Carta was humiliating, its provisions contained valuable insights—whether in its progressive legal principles or its emphasis on protecting commerce, aspects that previous kings and their councils had long neglected. Our advisors have drawn upon these lessons to shape new policies, allowing the winds of reform to sweep through the stagnant and archaic royal court once more."
 DD_FRA_ideas_4:"Assimilation Act"
 DD_FRA_ideas_4_desc:"Our eastward expansion was fiercely guarded against by the Emperor and his lackeys, while our advance south was blocked by the so-called 'Free Kingdoms' that once owed us fealty. Even dismantling the alliance between the northern Five Provinces and the Lowlands proved beyond our strength. With no other options, we reluctantly turned our gaze westward to the ocean. In the tales of bards, the distant seas held the promise of growth and hope—a pristine paradise untouched by strife. And indeed, the ships we sent forth with such hopes did not disappoint, eventually reaching the shores of that fabled land. Though it was another's paradise, it offered us the key to our predicament. Thus, we enacted the Assimilation Act—the Frankish ideal finally breaking free from its threefold shackles and finding new purpose. Though it was never our world to begin with, under the influence of the Assimilation Act, they shall one day share in our glorious future."
 DD_FRA_ideas_5:"Divine Right of Kings"
 DD_FRA_ideas_5_desc:"Whether it was Pepin the Short donating lands to the Pope or Charlemagne reigning over Europe, their legitimacy stemmed in part from the sanction of the Church—thus began the principle of the Divine Right of Kings. Times have changed; the Pope, once our close ally, has now fallen into corruption and lost his legitimacy, even turning his blades against his former benefactors. Yet the logic of divine right remains the foundation of our sovereignty and claims to the Frankish ancestral lands. As Catholicism fractures and Emperor and Pope turn on each other, we finally have the opportunity to redefine whose 'divine authority' grants royal legitimacy. Theologians in Paris have engaged in fervent debate, carving a new path separate from Rome and the Empire. Now, we stand with renewed conviction—ready to reclaim what was always rightfully ours."
 DD_FRA_ideas_6:"The French Standing Army"
 DD_FRA_ideas_6_desc:"Whether drawn from lessons of our past or warnings from fallen nations, all remind us of the need for a formidable standing army to meet the ever-present threat of war. When veterans grow weary and troops depleted, military strength cannot be assured; to rely on mercenaries is but to quench thirst with poison and heal wounds by cutting flesh. The strong make themselves stronger, while only the weak depend on others for survival. Thus, in the precious respite between ceaseless wars, we swiftly rebuilt a disciplined standing army—well-armored and sharply honed—to serve as the unshakable foundation of our diplomatic endeavors. With weapons sharpened and forces drilled to perfection, when the French army marches forth again, it shall sound the death knell for our enemies."
 DD_FRA_ideas_7:"The Fleur-de-Lis Reborn"
 DD_FRA_ideas_7_desc:"Sacred and pure... this was the original meaning of the fleur-de-lis, and the divine destiny of this ancient and holy Kingdom of France. From the moment Clovis I first grasped the scepter crowned with golden lilies, to the adoption of the fleur-de-lis as the emblem of the French royal house, these blossoms have carried France's glorious past while heralding her radiant future. Though after the tragedy of Poitou, our homeland fell, royal authority waned, and even the pristine fleur-de-lis was temporarily tarnished, lying dormant amidst broken lands. But the times have changed. After years of recovery, we have regrouped and returned to Europe's grand stage. The old order crumbles, while new sprouts push through the soil. This is the final act for the guilty, and the overture of rebirth. So let us march forth—for we are the ones who shall restore the fleur-de-lis to glory."

On the European mainland, our Union holds vast territories stretching from the Pyrenees in the south to the port of Calais in the north. Militarily, our formidable and loyal standing army has crushed the southern Free Kingdoms and torn apart the Emperor's prized containment network. In matters of influence, merely our stance can sway Iberian affairs, while the slightest eastern pressure makes the pretender emperor's heartlands tremble - sending both the once-arrogant Emperor and the treacherous, fallen Pope into panicked retreat. In the Union's early days, we trod carefully as if walking a fraying tightrope; but now, through a century of struggle, we have found the solution to break all constraints, cultivating resplendent fleurs-de-lis from scorched earth. Mighty France commands the land, and her deeds shall be carved alongside Charlemagne's in the halls of St. Peter's Basilica."

FR1_ideas_3_desc:"The establishment of Magna Carta marked our humiliating past, once the most glaring scar upon France's European dominance. Yet we refuse to cling stubbornly to bygone shame, choosing instead to embrace temporary defeat before advancing toward a hopeful future. When we again rose as conquerors over the continent, the ancient charter had transformed from shackles into sails for our voyage. Its provisions limiting royal power were adapted into measured regional autonomy, easing administrative burdens across our vast territories; while its legal and commercial articles—reinterpreted—were preserved as textbooks for our continental and maritime supremacy. When the old man lost his horse, who could have guessed it was a blessing? Now, within our revitalized court, the winds of change first stirred by Magna Carta centuries ago still surge with renewed force."
FR1_ideas_4:"England Commands the Seas"
FR1_ideas_4_desc:"The age of the House of Anjou shall never end. Upon the Atlantic waves, our Union controls ceaseless shipping lanes stretching west to the ocean's edge and east to the Baltic shores. In wealth, our prosperous and cunning merchant companies have conquered the northern Five Provinces League and shattered the Low Countries' lifeblood trade networks. Within our sphere, mere expressions of will determine the fate of North Sea nations, while slight manipulations upend coastal economies - leaving once-duplicitous counts and vacillating oligarchs bankrupt. During our initial landing on these isles, every step met obstacles as we teetered on the edge of reversal; but now, through a century's arduous journey, we've charted unknown realms, ultimately cultivating golden plantations from virgin soil. Free England commands the seas, and his ventures shall be recorded alongside Leif Erikson's voyages in the annals of the New World."
FR1_ideas_5:"Legacy of the Norman Conquest"
FR1_ideas_5_desc:"The Duke of Normandy's conquest of England stands as our most glorious and resplendent victory from ages past. William's enterprise provided us a secure foothold on the British Isles, while generations of stewardship laid the foundation for us to ride forth and conquer anew. The bonds between the Five Provinces and the Lowlands were severed in blazing artillery fire, Viking fervor faded with the last tide, and even the Highlands' epics dissolved into Scotland's mournful bagpipes. Now when we gaze back, the Channel lies undisturbed by waves; when we look around, our former mortal enemies tear at each other's throats. Some claim we cannot cross the Pyrenees, others insist we cannot restore the Carolingian legacy... But Duke William already showed us the way - just as he did, we shall brave the storm and reach that 'impossible' shore."

From the disastrous Albigensian Crusade to the Hundred Years' Civil War, this era became known as France's Dark Age. Endless wars and recurring calamities, coupled with bloody royal struggles in Paris, left the people in despair. Thus was born the French Restoration Society. Swearing before God the Father and our glorious ancestors, the Grand Marshal shall resurrect France and restore it to greatness. To this end, until true revival is achieved, France shall remain in a permanent national defense state, with the Grand Marshal wielding absolute power to mobilize all national resources and strength against our enemies."

When we again stand victorious over the continent, the Great Charter of old is no longer shackles that bind, but sails that carry us forward. Its clauses limiting royal power were transformed into moderate local autonomy, easing administrative burdens across our vast territories. Meanwhile, its provisions on rule of law and commerce were reinterpreted and preserved, becoming our textbook for dominating both land and sea. The old man lost his horse, but who could foresee it might be a blessing? And within our revitalized court still blows the winds of reform first stirred by the Great Charter centuries ago."

 FRC_ideas_bonus:"Frankish Ambition"
 FRC_ideas_1:"Frankish Century"
 FRC_ideas_1_desc:"In Charlemagne's hands, the mighty empire bearing this name knew brief glory before foundering at its zenith. Discontent subjects refused to support a unified center, while Carolingian heirs reveled in opulent dreams, blind to the century of warfare and conflagration to come. Charlemagne's tale became but a minstrel's legend, his ephemeral empire crumbling within thirty years of his death. Even the despairing remnants lost faith in Frankish restoration, burying themselves in cold reality—until now. We have gathered the scattered crowns and united them anew; divided peoples rally once more beneath a single banner at our command; the backward practice of partition inheritance is abolished, with supreme power transitioning swiftly and smoothly. Under our rule, the people prosper in peace and society stands firm. The 'Frankish Century'—our era shall be remembered thus by posterity."

 FRC_ideas_2:"Tempered Through Ages"
 FRC_ideas_2_desc:"As times changed, the great empire faded into shadow, and its despairing remnants gradually abandoned hope of restoration amidst endless wars, while the dream of a unified Western Europe briefly fell silent. Yet generation after generation of determined men toiled tirelessly - with sword and scepter, through policy and poetry - each in their own way preserving the glory of the ancient empire. It was against the dark backdrop of the Middle Ages that Frankish culture and spirit ultimately rose like a phoenix from the flames, shining brighter than ever. Having revived Charlemagne's legacy, the reborn Frankish realm inherits its former imperial majesty without its past vulnerabilities. Our battle-hardened armies strike like tigers sweeping through withered grass, while our formidable morale turns fragile enemies into panic-stricken foes trembling at mere rumors. Though seas may change to mulberry fields, Frankish greatness shall forever stand proud against wind and snow - tempered through ages."

 FRC_ideas_3:"Father of Europe"
 FRC_ideas_3_desc:"Charlemagne, the 'Father of Europe'. As a great conqueror, he was crowned Emperor of the Romans in St. Peter's Basilica, and the divided realms of East, West, and Middle Francia became the prototypes of future Germany, Italy, and France. Starting from our ancestral lands, we toiled through hardship and finally, centuries later, recreated the great achievements of Charles the Great, reclaiming all territories of the ancient empire. From the Atlantic to the Danube, from the Baltic to the Apennines, our people prosper across this vast domain. The reborn empire, through its superior governance, has earned recognition from all Christendom - even heretics and heathens - enjoying unparalleled diplomatic prestige. Now with the three realms united, none can hinder our advance, and our monarch shall carry forward Charlemagne's will and ambition as the new 'Father of Europe'."

 FRC_ideas_4:"Missionary Expansion"
 FRC_ideas_4_desc:"Though Clovis may have initially adopted Christianity merely as a tool to consolidate power and gain support, his successors came to embrace it sincerely, consciously supporting the Papacy's development. Pepin the Short donated lands to the Pope, who in turn crowned Frankish monarchs - their close cooperation facilitated both the spread of Christianity and Frankish territorial expansion through religious assimilation. Though circumstances have changed, we remain the spiritual successors of that ancient empire, maintaining the same expansionist approach through missionary work. Even as today's Papacy lacks its former majesty and Christianity faces schism, Franks must still unite under the Christian banner - in this our resolve remains steadfast. Whether facing traitors or heathens, we shall crush their resistance, purify their minds, and guide them toward universal acceptance - achieving their complete spiritual conquest."

 FRC_ideas_5:"Charlemagne's Legacy"
 FRC_ideas_5_desc:"Both his supporters and detractors must concede one truth - Charlemagne was a great and successful conqueror. The empire's remnants still yearn for his rule, and his legacy endures. His methods of conquest, policies of assimilation, and governance structures left indelible marks across every land he touched. Even as glorious memories fade, his presence remains eternally engraved in the hearts of Frankish descendants. Thus when we raised the Frankish banner to reclaim our realm, the seeds of identity Charlemagne planted centuries ago finally bore fruit. These remnants actively participated in building our newly conquered territories, helping rebuild Frankish political identity. They never forgot that great empire, nor that mighty conqueror - and we are now the inheritors of his precious legacy."

 FRC_ideas_6:"Paladins"
 FRC_ideas_6_desc:"While the great conqueror's deeds were recorded in history, his undocumented exploits were embellished and passed down as legends of saints. The stories of the Emperor's Paladins were likewise preserved, inspiring generations of knights to strive for excellence. The past may be fleeting as the wind, yet the wind never ceases. Though the Paladins have ascended to heaven, their legacy of glory, justice, and faith lives on, crystallizing into a new chivalric spirit. Now that Francia has returned to European soil, her Paladins may finally come home. In the imperial camps, new orders of knights assemble. Clad in armor and burning with morale, they live for dignity and honor, offering courage and devotion to the Lord - let us then witness the birth of new Paladins amidst the battle horns of charging cavalry."

 FRC_ideas_7:"Glorious Restoration" 
 FRC_ideas_7_desc:"The world is but a grand stage, and we merely players dancing to God's script upon Europe's platform. Yet it was only after surviving countless mortal trials and breaking through fortified barriers that we finally ascended to this stage - now too small for our stature - becoming the undisputed protagonists in God's divine play. But Francia's restoration is not the finale, only the overture; our journey stretches far beyond. We are destined to surpass Charlemagne's achievements, to reunite Europe once more... and then pursue even grander designs. The road ahead is long, but our lost galleon has found its bearing amidst the fog. Onward we march until journey's end; before the gates engraved 'Undreamt Dreams', we shall never rest."


#Replacing the original Brandenburg

 BRA_ideas_4:"The German Civil War"
 BRA_ideas_4_desc:"The German Civil War forever changed both the Holy Roman Empire and the German people. As one of the three main belligerents against the Hohenstaufens, Brandenburg not only led Northern Germany in casting off the Emperor's shackles, but also spearheaded the reconstruction of Northern German order. The civil war tempered Brandenburg through the cruelest baptism of fire, forging an elite army hardened by trial and creating Brandenburg's own sword of state."

 BRA_ideas_5:"King in the North" 
 BRA_ideas_5_desc:"With the Hohenstaufen constraint removed, Brandenburg has gradually become the undisputed King in the North, ruler of Northern Germany. Though losing influence within the Imperial Circles, the Northern German Confederation led by Brandenburg is emerging as a northern hegemon capable of counterbalancing the North Sea Empire, even checking its influence. As the frontline against barbarian incursions, Northern Germany stands firmly united under Brandenburg's banner, accepting the leadership of this authoritarian yet formidable King in the North."

 BRA_ideas_6:"Elbe Trade Network"
 BRA_ideas_6_desc:"With the Hanseatic League's support, Brandenburg gradually shook off imperial and Rhenish trade influence after being expelled from the Empire, establishing a new commercial web penetrating the entire north - the Elbe Trade Network. Though still in its infancy, this mercantile system has emerged as a formidable competitor in the struggle for North Sea trade dominance and eastern market penetration, backed by Hanseatic support and Anglo-Low Countries commerce, possessing limitless potential."

 BRA_ideas_7:"Royal Military Council" 
 BRA_ideas_7_desc:"Serving as both the Brandenburg monarch's private staff officers and the nerve center influencing the Northern German Confederation's military decisions, this French-inspired Royal Military Council comprises the king's most trusted and capable generals. This institution has become the cerebral core of Brandenburg's military policy and the sovereign's strategic think-tank. Gradually evolving into an indispensable component of both Brandenburg and Northern German armies, it functions as both brain and beating heart of Brandenburg's iron legions."

This great state, which once united the entire Apennines and single-handedly resisted the Hohenstaufen, is now aged and slowly approaching its grave. Yet, a group of people unwilling to accept defeat, obsessed with the golden age of the past, refuse to abandon their homeland or submit to its fate, composing an elegy of defiance against destiny."

LOM_ideas_2:"Dreamers Trapped in Yesterday"
LOM_ideas_2_desc:"Everyone yearns for change, everyone hopes for tomorrow. Whether eagerly anticipating the day this behemoth collapses or striving to save this mortally ill, pitiful mother, every Lombard desires transformation. The Lombard League, this ancient name, is like a prison trapping ambitious dreamers whose hearts burn with fervent fire—until one day, until one person shatters the shackles of reality and pulls the Lombards out of their painful past."

LOM_ideas_3:"Illusion of Freedom and Unity"
LOM_ideas_3_desc:"Freedom and unity—centuries ago, these two tenets upheld Lombardy's resistance against the Imperial House; now, these same tenets have become the battering ram shattering the League. Lombardy promised freedom to all, dreaming that unity could save this disintegrating alliance. When the fierce winds of ambition swept across the Apennine lands, the once-noble banner was long since swept into an unnoticed corner. Lombardy stands beneath a crumbling wall—if we do not change, if we cannot adapt, the League will cease to exist."

LOM_ideas_4:"Alliance of Scripture and Ambition"
LOM_ideas_4_desc:"In its founding days, Lombardy's enduring resilience on the Apennine frontlines relied heavily on the support of the Holy See. Throughout these centuries of history, the Church and its clergy have consistently been intertwined with Lombard politics. The Sanctuary Faction, as the League's third major faction, represents not only the stance of the Church but also the interests of clergy and politicians. Ambition drives the Church and its affiliated families, compelling them to meddle in Lombard politics. The Sanctuary Faction and its influence have become an indispensable part of the League, whether we like it or not."

LOM_ideas_5:"The Exiled Savior"
LOM_ideas_5_desc:"Genoa, once the backbone of the Lombard League, the core of resistance against Imperial aggression. This ancient republic was defeated by the Imperial Faction's ambitious schemes and expelled from the Lombard League. Genoa's exile marked the beginning of Lombardy's decline, yet the noble Genoese never abandoned the dream of Italian unity and independence. The Republican Faction, these Italian-born republicans, are striving with all their might to save their homeland. Though Lombardy once expelled Genoa, the suffering savior still remembers their mission—just like the Messiah once crowned with thorns."

But we have also witnessed nobility, courage, devotion, piety, and mercy. We have seen the knights of unity repel Imperial invasion, seen roses bloom splendidly upon ruins still ablaze. The long stairway to greatness opens before us. Lombardy, having endured the trials, is destined to reach the end of this arduous journey, ascending to the star-studded heavens."

The grandest epic, the most magnificent legend, cannot escape a destined conclusion. Lombardy was born from a legendary war and must inevitably end with a dramatic finale—but that is far too distant for us. In this vast, fleeting world, no dust remains suspended under the sun forever, yet our history of standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the sun and moon is not false. Even if all earthly dust ultimately returns to the ground, in this boundless mortal realm, at least we once streaked across the heavens like a shooting star."

GR1_ideas_2: "Kaiser's League"

These allied states will deeply integrate politically, economically, and culturally with our nation, fostering a sense of identity and solidarity with us."
GR1_ideas_3: "Chancellor System"
GR1_ideas_3_desc: "Through the Chancellor system and Imperial government reforms, Germany now possesses a mature modern political system. The Kaiser holds the power to appoint and dismiss the Chancellor, the President of the Imperial Diet, and the Imperial Chief Justice, as well as to veto and pass laws. The Chancellor, the President, and the Chief Justice exercise executive, legislative, and judicial powers on behalf of the Emperor. The leader of the Imperial government, the Chancellor, is elected by the Imperial Diet and recommended to the Emperor, while the cabinet is confirmed after the Chancellor selects a list of candidates for the Emperor's appointment. The Imperial Chancellor has evolved from the initial chief minister serving the monarch into the Empire's leader assisting the Emperor today, becoming one of the dual political centers of the German Empire."

DD_LAN_ideas_6:"The Sanctuary State"
DD_LAN_ideas_6_desc:"As former leaders of the Sanctuary Faction, we have maintained friendly, close ties with the Church, integrating ecclesiastical governance with temporal politics. By serving as the voice of the Holy See, our government holds absolute authority in lands faithful to God. Our state has become synonymous with piety and sanctity, enjoying considerable diplomatic advantages."
DD_LAN_ideas_7:"Gilded Republic"
DD_LAN_ideas_7_desc:"Though family members hold no significant public office, they firmly grasp the reins of power through finance, connections, and political maneuvering, happily using these means to expand the influence of both family and republic. Now, we have become the torchbearers of republican will; spreading the republican model to other nations is our mission. Through this guiding republican system, we control other states influenced by it, forming a vast family network. Later historians would call this guidance of republics the Medici System, or the 'Gilded Republic'."
