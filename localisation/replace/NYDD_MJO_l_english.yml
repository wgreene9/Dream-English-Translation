DD_MJO_1_t: "Century Escape"
DD_MJO_1_d: "Warriors view desertion as a disgrace, but in the face of an unstoppable disaster, perhaps fleeing is the only choice. Before the brutal and unstoppable French army, a group of desperate Englishmen chose to leave their war-torn homeland and set sail for the boundless sea. Their ancestral land burned in the flames behind them, and they could only ride the sea breeze mixed with embers and gunpowder smoke, fleeing to an unknown distance.\n\nA sorrowful wind of death and destruction chases the British wanderers, and the hopeful escapees have no time to look back at their suffering homeland. The flying flames dance wildly in the raging sea wind, and the billowing sails carry the lost travelers far away. Mallorca is the end of their escape. The destitute people set foot on this unfamiliar land and had to take up the trade of 'armed merchants.' In the corner of the world, a group of wandering souls yearns to return home."

Unfortunately, our homeland has long been reduced to ashes in the flames of the French, and the Iberian islands will not be our final destination. Our 'armed merchants,' forced by necessity, are often mistaken by the uninformed locals for the notorious pirates, which is far from the truth.\n\nWe are no longer the panicked fleet of exiles we once were; we have established a foothold in the Mediterranean. We will formalize our Mediterranean trade, establish a commercial republic for the English, and seek to accumulate greater wealth to prepare for our eventual return to our homeland."

DD_MJO_3_t: "Changing Customs"
DD_MJO_3_d: "After decades and centuries of immigration and cultural integration, the once British escapees have finally assimilated into this land. The culture of the Anglo people and the local traditions of the Iberians have blended and influenced each other, along with the migration of the Moorish population during the Reconquista and the influx of other European immigrants, gradually giving rise to a new people, a new culture.\n\nPrimarily based on the culture of the English escapees, mixed with Iberian Christian culture and Moorish traditions, this new people call themselves the New English. They see Iberia as their new homeland, yet still yearn for the land of Britain, even if they may no longer be familiar with it. Regardless, an unexpected candidate has ascended to the throne of Iberia as a victor—New England."

DD_MJO_4_t: "Brothers in Conflict"
DD_MJO_4_d: "Aetnia, meaning 'nation,' was originally just a club of high-ranking Iberians serving the New England government. As the issue of the native Iberians became more prominent, due to the efficient handling by these local government officials, the influence of the Aetnia Club gradually rose. Now, Aetnia has developed into an influential political group supported by the native Iberian population.\n\nAlthough this national group supports the New England government, they are still a potentially unsettling factor that could provoke the Iberians. Aetnia has gradually developed into an influential faction in the confederation's political life, attempting to steer government policies in favor of the native Iberians. Overall, such a development might not be bad for New England."
DD_MJO_4a: "But they are forming factions... can I assume that?"

DD_MJO_5_t: "Opposing Factions"
DD_MJO_5_d: "The unity of the Iberians has gradually caught the attention of the high-ranking New English. Although these prominent New English families initially scoffed at these actions, the increasingly united and powerful Aetnia has forced them to take action. A New English political group has been formed, the Wunid, a New English faction named after unity.\n\nIn the affairs of government power, the Wunid have begun to assist each other in resisting the influence of the Aetnia. Out of consideration for national unity, the competition between the two sides has not caused major conflicts. In fact, the rivalry between the two factions has even helped the development and refinement of this nascent nation. Perhaps we should continue to improve this system and create a political system of cooperation between the two sides."

DD_MJO_6_t: "Stepping Homeward"
DD_MJO_6_d: "The docks are bustling with sailors, and the flow of travelers is endless. Today, the port is particularly lively, with banners even hung on the streets. Ship after ship sails out of the harbor, and people's faces are filled with joyful smiles. Little Sancho rides on his father's shoulders, watching the white sails gradually disappear on the horizon. The setting sun dyes the distant waves red, and the undulating ripples push the ships further away.\n\n'Dad,' Sancho asks his father in confusion, 'where are people rushing to?'\n\n'Home, child,' the father simply stares at the gradually blurring horizon, then adds after a while, 'and our home too.'\n\n'But our home is here, isn't it?'\n\n'Another home, older, more unfamiliar, but also more closely connected to us.' The father gazes at the unknown distance, imagining the unknown homeland. It is the home of his father, his father's father, and their ancestors."

Although the bonds of our people still exist, they are deeply divided by cultural gaps. Their frightened eyes seem to speak of the arrival of another conqueror, and though we search in panic, we cannot find its trace. Finally, we realize that we can no longer be called a unified nation, and our political system probably cannot bear such a divided country.\n\nTherefore, upholding the sacred bonds of friendship and the principle of blood unity, our Act of Union will rebuild an Anglo Federation led by us. We were once one nation, one family, and now we will unite as close partners in this unbreakable covenant. No matter how history and time divide us, the same blood flows in our veins!"

DD_MJO_8_d: "Hundreds of years ago, when the Normans set foot on British soil, England was beset by internal and external troubles, surrounded by enemies. Our land was ravaged, our homes burned, and our people scattered and wandering. We were humiliated by others, forced to kneel, and bowed our heads in submission. Now, the tables have turned, and standing in the palaces of Paris are not the arrogant French conquerors, but the avengers from England.\n\nThe pain of the past will be repaid. We were not defeated by disaster and suffering, but have returned from the cracks of history. Our nation has once again taken the stage of history, and this time, we will lead the dance of the era. The rule of the French tyrant will be ended, and a new friendly government will stand with us, united in a future of peace and prosperity."
DD_MJO_8a: "Rule, Englishmen!"
DD_MJO_9_t: "Leviathan"
DD_MJO_9_d: "The sea remembers the immortal. 'This nation is destined to be the king of the ocean.'\n\nFrom the first white sail raised to the sky-covering sea wall, the New English navy has created their own myth. Some have succinctly commented: 'This is a super fleet with a nation.'\n\nFrom its inception, the nation's genes were engraved with the inscription of the sea. Once, young soldiers sang military songs, charging with crude weapons against enemy ships outnumbering them, their bodies turning into flames, bravely marching to their deaths. Now, their descendants already hold maritime supremacy, looking down on the world, chasing the wind, hoping for calm seas.\n\nAfter decades of development and accumulation, no one knows how many ships belong to this great nation, how many proud flags flutter in the sea breeze. People only know that when the news of great victories comes again, the triumphant fleet stretches for thousands of miles, and the taverns and inns in the city rush to stock up on wine, emptying their cellars. When the monsoon brings the blessings of the goddess of wealth, countless carriages block the roads to the ports, continuing into the night. The shipbuilding industry of New England has developed to an astonishing degree—craftsmen can build a satisfactory ship with two-thirds the cost and half the time. In [Root.Capital.GetName] alone, dozens of large shipyards stand, with tens of thousands of workers toiling day and night. They are not generals, politicians, or diplomats, but they support this maritime hegemon with their own hands.\n\nIn the endless blue, it devours all like Leviathan, never ceasing. In the eyes of the enemy, the sea monster is just a mythical creature, but this terrifying sea beast truly breathes. Being crushed by its abyssal maw seems to be the only tragic fate.\n\nThe horn sounds again, and countless people set out with dreams, facing storms and rain. The glory of New England will shine like the sun in the sky, forever illuminating the boundless sea."

DD_MJO_10_d: "With the reconquest of all of Iberia, the peninsula has returned to peace and tranquility, and the New England Confederation now stands on the land of the Iberian Peninsula. The ensuing question is, where should the capital and center of the new confederation be located? Due to the loose autonomous politics and ethnic issues across the confederation, people are fiercely debating the issue of the capital.\n\nToledo, the center of Iberia, a rising city, is well-suited for us to govern the entire peninsula. Seville in the south is a prosperous commercial center, a Moorish settlement, and a choice of tolerance and diversity. Lisbon in the west gazes at the boundless Atlantic, a beautiful coastal city full of opportunities and wealth. Valencia on the east coast is the hometown of the Knight of the Lake, El Cid, a romantic and historically significant choice."

DD_MJO_15_d: "It seems today must be a special holiday I'm unaware of, Henry thought, never imagining that the port of Lugo near the Bay of Biscay would gather such a large crowd of people and ships.\n\nIn Henry's vague childhood memories, the villages around the Minho River often became overcrowded due to the influx of too many refugees, always accompanied by robberies, murders, the cries of women and children, and the shouts of bandits... The once clear river often turned crimson from the bodies thrown into it.\n\nAfter the arrival of the English, his distant kin from the British Isles whom he had never met, such incidents had ceased. People could now cross the Cantabrian Mountains without fear of robbery or assault, caravans were continuous, and even lowly fishermen and farmers always wore smiles, happily discussing with their neighbors how much this year's harvest had increased.\n\n'What are you thinking about, silly boy?' an older youth came over and slapped Henry's back hard. John intended to give his younger brother a wonderful surprise. Today was 'Homecoming Day,' freely provided and organized by the New England Federation, allowing many English scattered across Iberia to safely travel by ship to the British Isles to visit relatives and elders who had stayed behind for various reasons.\n\n'Brother, are we going to board those ships and return to the city of London that you and father always talked about?'\n\n'Yes, you haven't met our grandfather yet. I received a letter from him the other day, inviting us to see the restored peace of our homeland.'\n\n'Great! Let's hurry and board the ship.'\n\nSoon, Henry and John boarded a majestic sailing ship that looked impressive under the sea breeze, the flag with a red dragon catching Henry's attention.\n\n'Brother, how long has it been since we left our homeland?' he couldn't help but ask.\n\n'It's been a very long time... Do you remember when father was still alive, he always told us that the day to return home would come?'\n\nHenry nodded, shifting his gaze from the flag to the calm sea in the distance, his eyes sparkling with long-awaited anticipation and hope."

DD_MJO_16_t: "Escape"
DD_MJO_16_d: "Galicia, located in the northwest corner of Iberia, was one of the chosen escape locations for the wandering English. After the Muslim invasion, a large number of refugees originally from the Visigothic Kingdom flooded into this area, which was later occupied by Andalusia until the Asturians reclaimed it in the ninth century.\n\nNear the Bay of Biscay, in the thick fog, several simple small wooden boats could be seen slowly approaching the coast of Lugo, as fragile and lonely as leaves trembling in the autumn wind.\n\nOld John used all his strength to row the oars, his small boat also carrying two children huddled together under a worn blanket, the older boy caring for his younger brother, his calloused hands wiping the sweat constantly beading on his brother's forehead.\n\n'Almost there... almost there...'\n\nOld John muttered for a long time, so long that he didn't even know what he was saying anymore. The last bit of food had been given to the children, and the typhoid fever caused by fatigue and cold was eroding his last vestiges of reason and strength, yet his tired eyes still fixed on the coast that seemed to move closer and then further away in the thick fog.\n\nHe hadn't figured out how he, penniless, would feed the two children after a successful landing, whether there were English settlements in Lugo, whether the locals would ostracize or even discriminate against them, or worst of all, if they would encounter bandits and be killed along with his children.\n\n'Thud!'\n\nThe heavy impact temporarily roused his blurred consciousness, and he quickly grabbed the children's hands and hurried onto the shore. After a glance back to confirm that his brother was following, he immediately staggered forward, looking for any sign of people.\n\nAfter walking for who knows how long, Old John was almost about to collapse when suddenly, a pair of strong hands lifted him up. 'Sir? What's wrong, sir? Are you a refugee fleeing from England?'\n\nHearing the familiar accent, Old John managed to squeeze out a faint smile, then fell forward and never got up again."
