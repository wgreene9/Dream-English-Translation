desc_DD_CRO_start_modifier: "After sweeping through the Balkans and conquering vast South Slavic lands, this has now become our burden."

DD_CRO_boom_desc: "At this point, there's no choice but to self-destruct."
DD_CRO_1_t: "Dilemma"
DD_CRO_1_d: "Croatia, or rather the Kingdom of Croatia and Dalmatia, is a kingdom trapped by circumstances—it declined under the iron heels of foreign invaders and also rose by their hands. Since the invasions by Venetians and Norman adventurers, this kingdom has lost its sovereignty. The Venetians ascended the Croatian throne, the Hungarians to the north gained the power to appoint governors, and the Normans obtained the lands they coveted, becoming local landowners.\n\nNow, Croatia's court is divided between Venetians and Hungarians, two great powers greedily sucking Croatia's lifeblood, while overbearing Norman landlords lord over the conquered. The incompetent Croatian government is nearly paralyzed, with both political factions fiercely contending for power, each hoping to drive the other completely out of the Balkan Peninsula. Now, Croatia must choose: rely on the all-powerful mercantile republic, or beg for the mercy of Hungary's Luxembourg family?"
DD_CRO_1a: "To this day, we can no longer do without the Venetian merchants."
DD_CRO_1b: "The Hungarian nobles are our ideal protectors."
DD_CRO_1c: "No matter what, Croatia remains Croatia."

DD_CRO_2_t: "Plunge into the Fire"
DD_CRO_2_d: "Croatia, this entity known as the Kingdom of Croatia-Dalmatia-Slovenia-Serbia, has finally crumbled—though it can hardly be called a natural demise. The chaotic and incompetent co-government and the wicked Norman landlords finally pushed the peoples of the Balkans beyond endurance. While the king of the Dandolo dynasty reveled in yet another banquet, an enraged Croatian noble drove a dining knife into his heart.\n\nThis palace coup irrevocably ignited the flames in Croatia. A local noble from Dalmatia proclaimed himself the new king, vowing to expel all foreign forces from Croatia. Ethnic militias and local nobles across the kingdom rose in arms, declaring their independence. Furious, Venice and Hungary declared they would never tolerate such an insult and would soon respond accordingly."
DD_CRO_2a: "Croatia stands unyielding!"
