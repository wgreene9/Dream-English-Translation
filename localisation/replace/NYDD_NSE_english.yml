DD_NSE_10_t:"The Northern Sea Route"
DD_NSE_10_d:"Centuries have passed since Leif Erikson discovered Vinland, and during this time, we never abandoned the Vinland colony. Countless Englishmen, Norse, and Celts pursued wealth and glory on voyages to Vinland. Initially, walrus ivory and whaling were profitable activities. But as the colony expanded, these profits became increasingly insufficient to maintain self-sufficiency. Finally, the pious King Olaf decided to intervene. He sent Christian missionaries and supply ships to Greenland, then onward to Vinland, spreading the Gospel of Christ across the ocean. Although increasingly harsh weather began mercilessly destroying colonies and supply ships, the Northern Sea Empire, with its vast territories and the dispatch of supply ships at any cost, ultimately ensured the Vinland colony's survival.\n\nHowever, this prosperity was short-lived. The ongoing Little Ice Age and the rebellion of Swedish Norse pagans dealt heavy blows to the Northern Sea Empire. The Vinland colony gradually became a burden, forcing the King to reduce supply ship sizes, allow local autonomy, and seek their own means of survival. If the Northern Sea Empire ultimately decides to abandon the colony, it would be a devastating blow to Vinland's inhabitants, as surviving alone in Vinland is nearly impossible, and returning to settle in Scandinavia or Britain is equally unlikely..."

DD_NSE_11_t:"The Final Farewell"
DD_NSE_11_d:"The longship sails flapped loudly in the sea breeze, gradually disappearing over the horizon. Perhaps they would never be seen again, Christopher thought. Centuries ago, the Norse discovered Vinland in such ships. Centuries later, their descendants would carry the news of Vinland's abandonment to distant lands. What a cruel winter. This frozen land once held the hope of a New World, and now that hope would be buried by blizzards. [Root.GetName] could no longer support this colony at the world's end. Vinland's fate would sink into oblivion, flowing into the deep sea of farewell."
