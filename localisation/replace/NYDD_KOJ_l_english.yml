DD_KOJ_1_t: "Sea of Blood"
DD_KOJ_1_d: "When the newborn daughter came into the world, no one would have thought she could become the future ruler of Jerusalem. In this land blessed by God, all the crusaders who fought for the holy cause never imagined that the Crusades would be so precarious. Rebellions, assassinations, all aimed at expelling these 'invaders', using every means possible. Members of the royal family fell one after another, until only this daughter—Diana—remained. The Knights of Jerusalem vowed to defend the holy city with their lives. They acted as regents during her minority and taught her the ways of governance. Perhaps the conciliatory policies worked, or perhaps it was divine protection, but the queen was fortunate to live to her adulthood. When the Grand Master returned the crown and scepter of Jerusalem to her, she smiled and accepted them, but then issued a terrifying command.\n\nThe blood of infidels flowed on the land of Jerusalem, seeping deep into the soil. The Knights defended their faith; there was no place for infidels here. Hatred is the lifeblood of war. The devastation of Jerusalem shocked both the Islamic and Christian worlds, as people were stunned by the queen's decisiveness and ruthlessness. Rumors could not sway the queen. She caressed the cross of Jerusalem and declared herself 'the Great'. There was no mercy, no forgiveness; in Jerusalem, infidels could only accept their fate.\n\nWhat did infidels mean to Diana? Enemies? They killed her parents when she was only eight years old. If her father had not foreseen the danger and entrusted her to the Knights to flee the city, if the Knights had not fought to the death, she would have shared the same fate as those who perished in the Holy Sepulchre.\n\nSubjects? Indeed, infidels were the main inhabitants of this land. To a lord, they were more valuable than the lazy Christian immigrants, capable of guarding the estate. But Diana did not see it that way. Infidels could be 'enslaved'; they did not need 'rights'. She never considered infidels as her subjects. Ultimately, they were just part of the property.\n\nTroops? Diana only trusted the Knights. Infidels were merely cannon fodder, sent to die in the front lines. Even when the Knights charged, they deliberately avoided their own infantry. But Diana would not. She told the Knights that those were just 'crops' that grew with the seasons, and they should not disrupt the charge formation.\n\nInfidels had become a knot in her mind, a lingering shadow, a nightmare that accompanied her every night. As her paranoia deepened, the bloodstains on her hands became harder to wash away. The pool of blood at her feet grew deeper and deeper..."

DD_KOJ_2_t: "The Last Crusade"
DD_KOJ_2_d: "Victory is an intoxicating wine, but also a deadly poison. The victory of the Crusades did not bring eternal harmony and beautiful peace, but ugly strife and vile conspiracies. The holy warriors once united under faith now bowed to the temptations of Satan, abandoning the spirit of the Crusades and defiling the soul of faith. People no longer cared for the cause of God or noble virtues, their eyes only on profit and power.\n\nWe are the last crusaders. As the sacred guardians of the Holy Sepulchre, we must shoulder the mission of God. The Sultanate of Egypt, this nest of sin, still looms at the gateway of the Mediterranean. A century ago, Frederick II saved the precarious Holy Land through astonishing diplomacy and a marriage alliance with Egypt's Al-Kamil, but now it is time to drive the infidels out of Egypt completely. Let us take up the sword and the cross once more, and reclaim the glory of the Crusades!"

DD_KOJ_3_t: "Victory of Jerusalem"
DD_KOJ_3_d: "When the armies of Jerusalem marched into Cairo, [Root.Monarch.GetName] watched with satisfaction as mosques collapsed one after another, minarets kneeling like giants, turning to dust. The crusader knights rode on tall horses, striding through the streets of Cairo, looking down at the fleeing refugees. Muslims scattered in panic, Cairo was now in our hands.\n\nThe Ayyubid army had long since disappeared after their defeat by the crusaders. Now, the city was left with only frightened people and rotting corpses in the streets. Without a doubt, the last crusaders now stood on the land where the prophet Moses began, returning from the land of milk and honey, reviving the gospel of the Holy Father."
DD_KOJ_3a: "And I will remain as ever."

DD_KOJ_4_t: "Sabbath"
DD_KOJ_4_d: "On that day, the two armies faced each other. The commander sat on a sand dune, weeping uncontrollably. Years of war had left both Jerusalem and the Ayyubid dynasty in ruins. The knights who once longed to restore the glory of the Crusades had gradually lost their fighting spirit, only hoping to return home by Christmas. As the fervor for Christ and Allah faded, the war finally revealed its grim and ugly nature.\n\nIn the end, both sides signed a peace treaty in Sinai. As the initiator of the war, Jerusalem returned Sinai and Suez to the Egyptian Sultan, finally achieving peace. One day, we will win everything for our Lord again."
DD_KOJ_4a: "Our Lord Christ is infinitely merciful, grant them rest."
DD_KOJ_5_t: "Crusader Defeat"
DD_KOJ_5_d: "Is it over? No one had anticipated this outcome. The crusaders, in the face of the Mamluks of Egypt, had thrown down their armor and fled back to Jerusalem in disgrace. A large number of knights and generals were captured by the Muslims, and we had to pay a hefty ransom to get them back. It seems that the descendants of Saladin have not disgraced their ancestor's name.\n\nThe Ayyubid dynasty, knowing when to stop, reclaimed almost all their former lands except Jerusalem. The fortresses along the Mediterranean coast were either demolished by Muslim armies or converted into their own strongholds. It is not hard to imagine that once the truce expires, Jerusalem will be next."

DD_KOJ_8_t: "Mamluk Coup"
DD_KOJ_8_d: "The recent disgraceful defeat of the Ayyubids against the Jerusalem crusaders has become common knowledge. Many Muslims have denounced the Sultan for betraying Allah and the trust of the faithful. People are shouting that the war and the rule of the Ayyubids are over, driving the fleeing Ayyubid family away. The Ayyubid family is at its end, no longer possessing the glory of their ancestor Saladin, and even the Bedouins would be hard to defeat.\n\nFollowing the will of heaven, a Mamluk officer named Nizar Baybars imprisoned the Ayyubid royal family, took over the remnants of the Sunni Caliphate and Egypt, and declared a military government, vowing to retake Cairo. They do not acknowledge Egypt's defeat, believing it was caused by despicable traitors, and they thirst for revenge against the crusaders."
DD_KOJ_8a: "This is not peace, but a truce!"
DD_KOJ_9_t: "Knightly Order Coup"
DD_KOJ_9_d: "The recent disgraceful defeat of the Jerusalem crusaders against the Ayyubids has spread throughout the Christian world. The crusaders have unanimously blamed the newly ascended paranoid queen [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Many Christians have denounced the crusaders for betraying God and the trust of the faithful. People are shouting that the war and the rule of the Hohenstaufens are over, and angry protests are taking place in the holy city. The credibility of the royal family has reached its lowest point, no longer possessing the glory of Barbarossa, and even the Bedouins would be hard to defeat.\n\nTo prevent her from making further mistakes and ultimately losing Jerusalem, the Grand Master of the Templars, in alliance with other knightly orders and nobles, secretly imprisoned the queen, took over the Holy Land and the holy city, and declared that Jerusalem is loyal only to God. They do not acknowledge the crusaders' defeat, believing it was caused by shameful apostates who betrayed God, and they vow to take revenge on the infidels."
DD_KOJ_9a: "We will reclaim everything!"

DD_KOJ_10_t: "Starlight in Blood"
DD_KOJ_10_d: "The Temple Mount witnesses great deeds, the Temple Mount witnesses sins, the Temple Mount witnesses the decline of the sacred, and the rise of wickedness. The Al-Aqsa Mosque—the Farthest Mosque, once defiled by Frankish infidels, once occupied by those who betrayed God, has now returned to our embrace. War, slaughter, humiliation. This atrocity in the name of faith has lasted for centuries; it is time to end this cycle of hatred and greed.\n\nBeneath the arches of the Temple, the painful wails of this land are hidden. No one cares, no one cares! The infidel conquerors only chant their holy scriptures aloud; the sons of Allah, driven by greed, fight only for their power and fame. Hatred burns like mad fire—who practices the teachings? Since when must truth be proclaimed by weapons? We will end this vile competition spanning a hundred years; we will restore peace to this holy land. How can the place where the Prophet ascended on his night journey be stained with the blood and fire of sinners?"
DD_KOJ_10a: "In that deep crimson pool of blood, a dazzling starlight flickers."
