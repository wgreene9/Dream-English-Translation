DD_armenian_religion: "Armenian Orthodox"
DD_armenian_religion_religion_desc: "Originating from the influence of Gregory the Illuminator on Tiridates III, Christianity was established as the state religion of Armenia. It does not recognize the Council of Chalcedon and advocates for Miaphysitism, thus remaining independent from mainstream Christian churches since the 5th century. The Armenian State Religion is primarily prevalent in the Armenian region."

rus_orthodox: "Rus' Orthodox"
rus_orthodox_religion_desc: "Beginning with the Baptism of Rus', Kiev has always been one of the centers of the Orthodox world. After the fall of Byzantium due to the Fourth Crusade, the Rus' Patriarchate became de facto independent, no longer subject to the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople. Through a series of Slavic creations and developments, the Rus' Orthodox Church has become the de facto dominant force in Eastern Europe."

greek_orthodox: "Greek Orthodox"
greek_orthodox_religion_desc: "Since the division of the Roman Empire, the Eastern Roman Empire inherited its portion of the church, with its theology rooted in the early Church Fathers and Byzantine culture. With the fall of Byzantium, the Orthodox world gradually moved towards complete fragmentation, and the authority of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople has waned. Today, the influence of the Greek Orthodox Church is mainly present in the Greek region."

NYDD_bosnia_religion_religion_desc: "Originating from the teachings of the Gnostic sect of the First Bulgarian Empire, Bogomilism opposes state and church authorities, advocating a return to early Christianity, conducting rituals outdoors rather than in churches, and believing that the world was created by an evil demon. Today, Bogomilism is primarily prevalent in Bosnia."

roma_catholic: "Roman Catholic"
roma_catholic_religion_desc: "Centuries of grievances led to an uncontrollable conflict between the Emperor and the Pope, who chose to excommunicate the Emperor as usual. However, this time the Emperor did not yield and declared the sacraments of the Holy Roman Empire to be independent. Those who still followed the Pope and acknowledged the authority of Rome were called Roman Catholics, while those who sided with the Emperor were called Imperial Catholics. Thus began the second great schism in Christianity. Unlike previous schisms, this one might be permanent."

khawarij: "Kharijite"
khawarij_religion_desc: "The Kharijites, an ancient Islamic sect, emerged during the era of Caliph Ali, like the Sunnis and Shiites, and caused great turmoil in the Arab world by assassinating Ali and Muawiyah. They oppose both Shiite and Sunni views, advocating for the strict election of leaders based on Islamic egalitarian principles. Any Muslim, regardless of status or ethnic background, who possesses the necessary leadership skills, has the right to be elected, even a slave. The Caliph must strictly obey Allah, otherwise, he should be overthrown. They aim to establish a 'democratic Islam,' abolishing the custom of inheriting leadership through tribal or blood relations, and place great emphasis on Sharia, advocating for the equal distribution of land and spoils among all Muslims, hence also known as the Military Democrats. After being exiled to Mesopotamia, they launched uprisings against the Caliph, which were suppressed several times. Today, besides the followers hidden in Mesopotamia, there are remnants who have sailed into exile in Iberia."

HOLY_SITE_1878_DESC: "Aachen, capital of the Frankish Empire, stood as the center of Charlemagne's power - the brightest jewel in the crown of the 'Father of Europe', the 'Cradle of Europe'. This city represents the sacred legacy and glorious traditions of the Holy Roman Empire through centuries, serving as both the heart of the double-headed eagle and a museum of Charlemagne's enduring heritage."

HOLY_SITE_85_DESC: "As a Hanseatic member and seat of the Archbishop of Cologne, this city remained the economic and religious center of northern Germania, even serving once as capital of a Frankish kingdom. The Rhine's watery crossroads made Cologne perpetually vital to the Empire, particularly under its archbishop's influence."

HOLY_SITE_1876_DESC: "Legend tells that after a defeat, Charlemagne retreated to the Main River where his army found no ford - until a doe appeared to guide them across. In gratitude, he founded Frankfurt ('Ford of the Franks'), which became the Frankish secondary capital and German political center, hosting Imperial Diets as a Free City."

HOLY_SITE_80_DESC: "The episcopal seat of Trier, oldest city in Germania dating to Augustus' Rome, was chosen by Western Emperor Constantius I as his residence. These classical stones testify to the Holy Roman Empire's unbroken lineage from Rome, proclaiming its unquestionable legitimacy."

HOLY_SITE_104_DESC: "Milan's cathedral safeguards Christendom's holiest relics - the Shroud, Holy Nails, and True Cross fragments. As political center of the Italian Kingdom (one of the Empire's four pillars), this city dominates northern Apennine commerce and faith alike."

HOLY_SITE_118_DESC: "The Eternal City and sacred capital, Rome provides the Holy Roman Empire's divine legitimacy. Since Pepin's Donation, it has housed God's humblest shepherd - the Servant of Servants - making the Papacy's continued allegiance proof that the Empire remains Christendom's undisputed protector and arbiter."

HOLY_SITE_266_DESC: "The City of a Hundred Spires and cultural capital, Prague once ranked among Europe's greatest political, economic and cultural centers. As capital of Bohemia (one of the Empire's four kingdoms), it stood as testament to West Slavic loyalty to the Imperial crown."
