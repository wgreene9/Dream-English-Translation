 DD_CST_1_t: "The Last Rome"
 DD_CST_1_d: "Rumble, rumble.\nPeople born between two seas, do you hear the lingering tremors from the heart, see the hope for freedom of life?\nBefore the glory of Rome turned to ashes, the gem-studded altar stood safely, before the statue of Helen still symbolized past pride, the corpses in the royal tombs rested in peace.\n\nAnd it was in this place where epics were sung, a massacre of the Latins, the atrocity of Dandolo occurred.\nMules and horses under the city walls carried loot, monks in churches were forced by malicious whims to knock off gilded ornaments.\nThe fire raged on.\n\nAncient statues were wantonly pushed into furnaces to be cast into copper coins, parchment books were rudely burned for warmth.\nThe memory of civilization was obliterated.\n\nNuns were disgraced on the holy altars, commoners were tortured for hiding gold, the bones in the tombs were plundered, neither the living nor the dead could find peace.\nPeople screamed under the atrocities of the Crusaders.\n\nBefore the desperate tolling of the funeral bell, people heard news from the West and went to pray to the saints and the Basileus. Until late at night, the last murmur of hope, direction, self, and belief ceased.\nThe streets of the Golden Horn echoed with footsteps, the neighing of carriages, and the falling of ship banners at midnight. What seemed like suspicious behavior unexpectedly brought peace to the people's spirits. On that day, the emperor himself gave a speech, claiming that the dear Basileus would lead by example to launch a night attack on the Crusaders, and within ten days a triumphal ceremony would be held.\n\nIn those few days of peaceful sleep, the people's hope for war stability quickly turned into deep despair. Everyone was deceived; the so-called peaceful war of those princes and nobles was nothing but flight! They went to the West but did not know where to return, and so the suffering began, though I must omit the description of those sufferings.\n\nToday, in the West, only the Komnenos-Doukas family in Thessalonika is fighting alone. In the North, Manuel of Theodoro is trapped in the Crimean Peninsula. In the East, the Pontics and Cappadocians are nowhere to be found. In the South, the Greeks are bowing and scraping, fighting for the Latins.\n\nYou might ask how we can win? I think it comes down to comparing advantages:\n\"Compared to the brave men of the West, we have fewer enemies around us and more compatriots by our side.\"\n\"Compared to the loyalists isolated overseas in the North, we have better geographical advantages and a safer situation.\"\n\"Compared to the cowardly stammerers in the East, we are braver, facing harsher realities, not like ostriches digging holes to hide from the Turks.\"\n\"Compared to the traitors in the South fighting for the Latins, I think we are more discerning and more willing to defend our freedom with our lives.\"\n\nCompatriots, after saying so much, I think, I think, what will you think? A perfect opportunity lies before us. The Latins are fleeing in disarray to Adrianople, yet they still dare to threaten us, bringing their ragtag army of stick-wielding jesters to our gates. And the Turks are like the sword of Damocles hanging over the neck of the Latin emperor, stationed in Gallipoli like a pair of horns. Think about what I just said; the threat of the Latins is so laughable. Compatriots, we have nowhere to retreat; behind us is the last Rome. Will you steadfastly defend the mother of all cities for immortal honor? Or will you wait for the fake king from the West to come, take our weapons, and cut off our heads?"
