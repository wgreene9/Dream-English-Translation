NYDD_20_last_crusder_BOOKMARK: "The Last Crusader"
NYDD_20_last_crusder_BOOKMARK_DESC: "The Levant and North Africa have enjoyed over a century of peace since the Crusaders' decisive victory. The Crusaders' arrival brought little fundamental change to Muslim lands. Instead, under the watchful eyes of the Pope and Christian nations, nascent Crusader states must cooperate with infidels to prevent territorial erosion. The Crusaders hold most coastal areas but never ventured further inland - where harsh weather exacts immeasurable tolls. Yet fortune is fickle. Should Crusader states first quell internal strife, who's to say they cannot launch new crusades to annihilate enemies? Prolonged peace has dulled the sharpest warriors, while desert Muslims await their moment to strike when Crusader weakness shows. Under endless sands, undercurrents stir. The fragile calm hangs by a thread."

#1122 AD - A conqueror of destiny was born from the union of Hohenstaufen and Welf, heralding the dawn of an era for one of history's mightiest and most enduring dynasties—the Iron Century. Yet now, three centuries later, the Hohenstaufen Empire stands as a withered giant, staggering toward its inevitable end. This once-ferocious colossus has, over three hundred years, imprinted its royal mark upon all of Europe, forcing weaker houses and nations to writhe in suffering and humiliation beneath the rule of the Swabian Lion. But today, as the iron throne of the old era crumbles into dust within the fading illusion of imperial supremacy, what shall the humiliated vanquished do?

#Across the Rhine, the fractured realm of the Fleur-de-Lis still waits in division and fury, yearning for the day when their unbroken homeland may rise anew from the flames. On the peninsula of Lesser Britain, the generals who once fought for their king now pass their remaining days in struggle and doubt, while the Bretons refuse to resign themselves as mere pawns of Paris. Beneath the imperial shackles of so-called "divine right," the Low Countries remain the Hohenstaufen’s granary, loyally serving their monarch—until the day the Empire grows too weak to hold its chains.

#Down the surging rivers, an empire once deemed eternal now marches toward its demise. Along the Elbe, Brandenburg, unwilling to accept defeat in the Northern Wars, vows to reunite its people under the banner of a King of the North; the Habsburgs, ever the Emperor’s faithful hounds, bask in the prestige of the Palatinate; Bohemia, the frontline of religious strife, still writhes in the throes of civil war; and in Styria, the Wittelsbachs watch the slow descent of the iron curtain, their ambitions burning bright. Far to the south in Italy, the Lombard League—once the Hohenstaufen’s greatest foe—now collapses into ruin, its future shrouded in storm and shadow.

#A glorious lineage returns to dust; a proud name fades into silence. The double-headed eagle’s authority is but a shadow of its former self, yet the Emperor of Swabia refuses to yield. Not a single inch of the old Frankish Empire knows peace today.
