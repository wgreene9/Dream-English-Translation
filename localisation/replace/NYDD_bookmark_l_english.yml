NYDD_20_last_crusder_BOOKMARK: "The Last Crusader"
NYDD_20_last_crusder_BOOKMARK_DESC: "The Levant and North Africa have enjoyed over a century of peace since the Crusaders' decisive victory. The Crusaders' arrival brought little fundamental change to Muslim lands. Instead, under the watchful eyes of the Pope and Christian nations, nascent Crusader states must cooperate with infidels to prevent territorial erosion. The Crusaders hold most coastal areas but never ventured further inland - where harsh weather exacts immeasurable tolls. Yet fortune is fickle. Should Crusader states first quell internal strife, who's to say they cannot launch new crusades to annihilate enemies? Prolonged peace has dulled the sharpest warriors, while desert Muslims await their moment to strike when Crusader weakness shows. Under endless sands, undercurrents stir. The fragile calm hangs by a thread."
