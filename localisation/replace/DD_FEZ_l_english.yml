Were it not for the family crest in the boy's hand, he could scarcely believe that Prince Alfonso's youngest son had fled all the way from Tunis - an arrow still lodged in his back. The ghastly wound and bloodstained clothes told the whole story: this boy had nothing left. He had gambled his future and fate on a desperate horseback flight.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] studied the boy intently, listening to his labored, painful breathing - almost hearing the pounding heartbeat like a pendulum striking metallic notes. When soldiers found him unconscious in the outskirts, he was barely clinging to his saddle. Now he teeters at death's threshold. The Governor's brow furrowed deeply, wrestling with the choice that would determine both this boy's fate and the destiny of these lands."

Cunning opportunists ignited the wildfires of conflict, yet proved incapable of ending the chaos. Thus we came, and before the unstoppable blades of our Crusade, neither Muslim nor Christian, neither ancient kingdom nor upstart warlord could stand.

DD_FEZ.2.d: "Mauritania - a name both foreign and familiar. Founded by a hero, yet no monarch since has been willing to shoulder its legacy. To the common folk, Mauritania resembles less a real historical kingdom and more an ethereal legend, a beautiful fable - anything but an actual nation, a people, or an identity.\n\nBut winds change direction.

DD_FEZ.3.t: "The Maghrebi Nuptials"
DD_FEZ.3.d: "Ignatius, the exile's son weathered by desert sands, finally shed his boyish demeanor beneath the palace walls of Fez. Now he stood upon the dais, his gaunt frame draped in gold-embroidered robes like an unsheathed scimitar - silent yet keen-edged. The Governor's daughter Teresa stood with bowed head, the emerald-and-moonstone silver chains beneath her veil trembling like tamarisks whispering in the night wind. The wedding ceremony rivaled the Crescent Festival in splendor, every blessing dripping with the sweetness of camel's milk and dates.\n\nAs night fell and the wedding drums faded, the Governor sat alone in his chamber, fingers tracing the copper chest bearing his family crest. Stroking his beard with a sigh, his clouded eyes flashed with falcon-like intensity. He had given his daughter to this exiled prince like tossing a poisoned gold coin onto the gaming table. Five years ago when African royal blood stained Tunisian sands, he had taken in this dying orphan; now, as Fez faced its turbulent future, he needed both a puppet and a sword - and this political marriage was the forge to meld them as one."

# DD_FEZ.4.d: "Agony.\n\nClosing his eyes, the phantom sensations returned - the scorched air, the feverish pain, the crimson madness of flames. That fateful night drenched in blood and fire haunted Ignacio's mind like an infernal nightmare. Screams, pleas for mercy, the crackling flames like demonic claws forever scratching at his rage-filled heart.\n\nThe familiar stench of burning snapped him back to reality. A foul, blistering wind tugged at Ignacio's cloak as he beheld the man upon the white steps - the demon who had destroyed everything. The hatred pulsing through his veins moved his limbs as it always had, his heart pounding - his soul trembling. 'Rodrigo!'\n\nIn furious motion, he drew his sword and pointed it at the king upon the high steps, 'I am Ignacio de Vivar, true ruler of Africa!'\n\n'So you're that runaway child...' The setting sun dyed the Maghreb sky blood-red as ember-filled winds lifted Rodrigo's robes like frenzied white feathers.\n\n'You're much... much better than your father.' His lips curled slightly as he leisurely drew his own blade, casually pointing it at the avenger below. The gale blew back his jet-black hair, revealing those golden, hawk-like eyes, 'If you wish to save this nation, then try me!'\n\nLoathing transformed into boiling blood. Never before had Ignacio's eternally burning heart of hatred pulsed so violently. Deep in his soul, the family he'd tried so often to grasp in memory flickered before him - but their faces remained obscured by blood, unrecognizable. Vengeance twisted his features as he charged forward."
# DD_FEZ.4.a: "Agony is life's epic poem."
DD_FEZ.4.d: "\"Agony, agony is the epic of life.\"\n\nClosing his eyes, the acrid-smelling air, the painful burning fever, the crimson maddening flames—all flashed by like phantoms of the past. That fateful night dyed in blood and fire haunted Ignacio's mind like an infernal nightmare, clinging to him day and night. Screams, pleas for mercy, the crackling dancing flames like demonic claws forever scratching at his heart filled with wrath.\n\nThe familiar scent of burning snapped him back from his waking nightmare. The scorching wind, reeking of blood, billowed Ignacio's coat as he felt a phantom pain like ants gnawing at his left leg. He saw the man upon the white steps—the devil who had humiliated him, slaughtered his people, and destroyed everything he held dear. The hatred coursing through his veins moved his limbs as it always did; his heart pounded—his soul trembled. \"Rodrigo...\"\n\n\"Ro-dri-go!\" He drew his sword in fury, pointing it at the monarch upon the high steps. \"I am Ignacio de Vivar, son of Alfonso de Vivar whom you murdered—the true lord of Africa!\"\n\n\"That child who fled on horseback with Alfonso...\" The crimson sunset dyed the Maghreb skies blood-red as the spark-filled north wind lifted Rodrigo's coat like frenzied white plumage. \"You've improved... greatly... compared to your father.\" His lips curled slightly in amusement as he leisurely drew his sword, casually pointing it at the avenger below.\n\n\"If you wish to bring this blood feud to its conclusion,\" the gale blew back his jet-black hair, revealing those golden hawk-like eyes, \"then stake your soul upon it—if you can save this nation!\" The loathing fury became boiling blood; Ignacio's heart, eternally burning with hatred, had never raged as wildly as today. Deep in his soul, the family he'd tried so often to grasp in his dreams flashed before him again—but their faces in his memory were blurred beyond recognition by blood. The hatred of vengeance twisted his features as he charged forward."

DD_FEZ.5.t: "A Matter of Business"
DD_FEZ.5.d: "With the usurper dead and gone, we have inherited nearly all of the Crusader's legacy, and the Maghreb stands on the verge of complete unification. Yet on an eastern isle, Genoa still clings to that eyesore of a trading post. While controlling this insignificant island would bring little profit, to our Governor, bedbugs at one's side are more detestable than enemies on the battlefield - especially when they're money-grubbing Italians.\n\nFortunately, Genoa's Doge has wisely recognized our determination to unify the Maghreb. His envoy comes bearing a rather reasonable offer - requiring only some gold in exchange."
DD_FEZ.5.a: "At any cost."
DD_FEZ.5.b: "Perhaps not."

DD_FEZ.6.t: "The Long Road"
DD_FEZ.6.d: "The Holy War is our birthright and our destined curse. From Iberia to the Mashriq, from the Way of St. James to the Holy Sepulchre - how many lives must be sacrificed, how much blood drained, how many souls spent to traverse this arduous path? What more must we give to prove our devotion, defend our faith, and redeem our spirits? The Lord of Mercy watches over our journey, our sins, and our karma.\n\nYet now we stand beyond vengeance. We have crossed the river of hatred, and our sacred mission has not been forsaken by God's flock. Neither soul nor conscience nor life itself; neither bloodshed nor sin nor purgatorial flames have stopped us on this eternal night's journey. Never have we faltered, never lost our way. Now the world entrusted by the Heavenly Father, the ideal longed for by the disciples - from shore to shore, all holy lands bask in the Gospel's radiance. This road that once seemed endless, we have finally walked to its end."
DD_FEZ.6.a: "'A great work, accomplished by a great man.'"
DD_FEZ.6_buff: "Manifest Destiny"

DD_FEZ.7.t: "Those Countless Springs"
DD_FEZ.7.d: "Spring winds are often gentle - even along North Africa's sandy shores, caressed by tender early spring. Blossoms dance with startled magpies and wandering birds across the sky. Who could imagine such vibrant spring scenery emerging from winter's deathly silence? Beneath this sapphire-washed sky lies a world both mild and leisurely.\n\nDrifting cherry petals fall like jade feathers, spiraling through the air before alighting reluctantly on the man's shoulders. He wears no crown nor silken robes, bears no scepter nor sword - only standing quietly on Africa's shore, watching the spring tides. Lively kingfishers, riding sea breezes, perch lightly on emerald branches, bending one peaceful spring after another."
DD_FEZ.7.a: "'May every spring arrive as promised.'"

DD_FEZ.8.t: "Those Countless Springs"
DD_FEZ.8.d: "In the church where requiems resounded, the funerals of the former King and Regent were held together. Majestic hymns echoed beneath the towering dome as spring's golden sunlight gently sprinkled like gold dust upon the cross-emblazoned coffins, casting a dazzling radiance. The new King of the Fez dynasty sat in the corner of the first pew, fidgeting with the cross in his hands.\n\n'Your Majesty,' an attendant whispered, handing him a letter sealed with the kingdom's crimson insignia. The jet-black ink on the paper appeared freshly dried. The King merely glanced at it before folding and tucking it into his sleeve. 'Uncle has left us quite an astonishing legacy.' With a long sigh, the King turned his gaze to the crucified Christ in the sanctuary. The blinding spring light streamed through stained glass windows, spilling past Christ's outstretched arms, making it hard to distinguish what lay ahead."
DD_FEZ.8.a: "'May every spring arrive as promised.'"

DD_FEZ.9.t: "Beyond the Rules"
DD_FEZ.9.d: "The Regency's scope of power remains deliberately vague. Compared to his young monarch, the Governor clearly possesses far greater experience in statecraft. By circumventing tedious formalities and complex procedures, he could significantly improve administrative efficiency while expanding his influence. Yet from a long-term perspective, stricter adherence to vassal protocols might better serve our reign."

DD_FEZ.10.t: "At the Negotiating Table"
DD_FEZ.10.d: "Though we're no longer a minor vassal of that former behemoth, the Governor still insists on personally handling foreign envoys. After all, compared to unreliable noble diplomats, keeping all bargaining chips firmly in one's own hands seems prudent. Now that we have a new monarch, perhaps testing Ignacio's diplomatic skills would be wise - or the Governor could again demonstrate who truly wields the nation's power."
DD_FEZ.10.a: "I'll handle this myself."
DD_FEZ.10.b: "Ignacio can manage - I trust him."

DD_FEZ.11.t: "Amidst the Night"
DD_FEZ.11.d: "Fire—cruel and furious flames. A raging wildfire seemed rooted in the Governor's chest, relentlessly consuming his aged and feeble body until every last bone turned to ash and fell into the abyss. The flames of ambition, oh the flames of ambition—this demonic spark, this uncontrollable inferno had driven him down a path of no return.\n\n'You wished to see me?' The Governor strained to lift his heavy eyelids, gazing at the Vivar dynasty's king before him. The river of fate was a beast that devoured the past, mockingly toying with time's hands. The boy who had once lain dying in the desert now stood before him, while the once-vigorous Governor waited for death like a walking corpse. The scorching flames licked at his decaying heart, pulsing like a devil's footsteps.\n\n'Forgive me, Ignacio.' As the assassin's blade pierced the king's chest, the blood-drenched youth stared in shock at his savior. Staggering backward, he fell silently—like every king who had ever tumbled from his tower."
DD_FEZ.11.a: "The candle has been extinguished."

DD_FEZ.12.t: "Amidst the Night"
DD_FEZ.12.d: "Regrets... so many regrets. Not a magnificent life, perhaps, but certainly not an idle one. Never ambitious, only seeking comfort and glory - yet saving that reckless young fool set me on this turbulent, bloody path. And now I must fall behind the scenes, unable to see that hotheaded idiot through to the end.\n\n'Ignacio...'\n'I'm here.' The young king hurried closer, grasping the wrinkled hand.\n'Listen well... though these words may be unfit coming from me.' The Governor coughed out labored, painful breaths, his aged yet ocean-deep blue eyes fixed on the anxious but no-longer-youthful face. 'You will become a true monarch. Not just wearing a crown, but ruling a kingdom. You are an eternal flame - fueled by rage and vengeance thus far.' He drew a deep breath, as if expelling his remaining life. 'So keep burning - not for yourself, nor for vengeance, but for your kingdom.'\n\n'Ignacio... become the king you were meant to be.'"
DD_FEZ.12.a: "The candle has been extinguished."

DD_FEZ.13.t: "Crusade's Fervor"
DD_FEZ.13.d: "The Crusade's mission is the foundation of our national unity, its purpose the compass guiding our campaigns. As our piety and holy war efforts flourish, the time has come to convert this religious zeal into tangible benefits. For the Governor, bestowing these blessings presents an opportunity to consolidate power while sanctifying our young monarch, ensuring his reign's longevity and stability."

DD_FEZ.14.d: "The Crusade's holy mission often requires the Governor to personally lead armies against unrepentant heathens. But with our monarch now grown, a thorny dilemma emerges. Leaving Ignacio at court would grant him governing experience - potentially undermining the Regency's power. Yet dragging the king to war denies him political education while exposing him to battlefield dangers. Regardless, the Governor must choose what best serves the realm's interests."

DD_FEZ.15.a: "The time isn't ripe... but we must act!"

DD_FEZ.16.t: "Missive from Fez"
DD_FEZ.16.d: "Though we lost control of the western territories during the Great Revolt, today the Governor of Fez has sent surprisingly humble correspondence seeking Africa's aid. He pledges that should we rescue Fez from its turmoil, the province will rejoin Africa's administrative jurisdiction once order is restored."
DD_FEZ.16.a: "Accept his terms - there's no long-term disadvantage."
DD_FEZ.16.b: "Can't he govern his own lands?"

DD_FEZ.17.t: "Right-Hand Man?"
DD_FEZ.17.d: "Gradually, Ignacio has transformed from that helpless boy in memory into a spirited young man - passionate about horsemanship and archery, now taking interest in state affairs. Sometimes the Governor sees glimpses of his own long-dead son, yet knows Ignacio remains Vivar blood. Perhaps he could share some power to nurture a capable monarch... or tighten his grip to further cement authority."

DD_FEZ.17.b: "Power rightfully belongs to Ignacio."

DD_FEZ.18.t: "Crossroads"
DD_FEZ.18.d: "Independence from our former overlord has brought difficult days, chief among them the ceaseless religious strife within our borders. Though nominally a holy Crusader state, our realm remains predominantly Berber - a people unwilling to be tamed. The rift between paladins and Muslims widens daily, each faction demanding the Governor's favor. The fundamental question remains: which path shall we take?"

DD_FEZ.20.t: "Approaching the End"
DD_FEZ.20.d: "Today marked the Governor's seventieth birthday, with nobility and dignitaries gathered to celebrate another year of his regency's leadership. At the banquet, Ignacio and Teresa flanked the Governor - this familial harmony symbolizing the realm's stability.\n\nThe crisis struck abruptly. As the Governor rose to speak before the expectant crowd, he suddenly clutched his chest in agony, coughing blood before collapsing into his chair. A pale Teresa immediately helped her father retreat to his chambers, while a troubled Ignacio dismissed the guests, abruptly ending this ill-fated celebration."
