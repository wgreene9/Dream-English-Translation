DD_SEL_1_t: "The Rise of [Root.GetName]"
DD_SEL_1_d4: "Like a fleeting dream, the Sultan thought. Over four hundred years ago, when his ancestors faced the armies of Rome and the East, confronted throne claimants clad in cold steel, and beheld the fractured steppes, did they feel the same bewilderment and emotion as he does now? Through the long centuries, the empire forged by the ancestors' iron cavalry, the united nation under the eagle's wings, descended into division and ruin in the hands of successive heirs. The valiant lion was buried beneath the sands of Anatolia.\n\nNow, the empire stands under the crescent moon, and the Turkic people have rallied once more beneath the banner of the double-headed eagle. This faith-torn people, this land of fragmented territories, this forgotten and despised lion, once again stands upon the tide of the times. Clad in white, the Sultan marches to certain death against the enemies of the empire, in the name of the Valiant Lion - Arslan."
DD_SEL_1_d3: "The blades of the Crusaders tore through the lands of the Islamic world and shattered our pride. Our ancestors were once princes of the Seljuks, who, after being struck by Christian armies, resolved to depart, bowing their noble heads to the gospel of Saint Peter. The great realm built by our forefathers turned to ashes in the smoke of war; the lands bound together by violence ultimately perished by violence. The valiant lion was buried beneath the sands of Anatolia, entombed in blood and fire.\n\nBut the noble blood of Arslan will not accept defeat. The sand lions of Anatolia are not mediocrities who yield to fate. Our brethren who follow alien faiths may not understand, our divided and estranged kin may not approve, but we have made our choice, reuniting the nation of the Turkic people once more. War and bloodshed can never enslave, can never defeat the Turks. The great Lion of the Yellow Sands has returned to the lands of Anatolia, treading upon the corpses of all ambitious rivals, ascending the ancient throne of the Seljuks. The Trinity surpasses all creations under heaven!"
DD_SEL_1_d2: "There was almost no suspense; the most powerful Ottoman tribe once again leads all Turks. This is not the first time, but rather the third instance. Although each challenge against the behemoth from the East ended in failure, the Ottomans were never completely crushed. Now, truly, it is a time of rising warmth awakening hibernation. The chains from the East are fragile, and the warring neighbors to the West are merely a feast waiting to be consumed. The Ottoman era is at hand!\n\nResistance and courage are the bones of the Ottomans, while endurance and biding time are their blood. Conquerors from the East brought the culture, institutions, and technology of distant China, and the Ottomans, appointed as tax collectors, absorbed vast nourishment. The Rites learning compiled by the legendary Zhao Wu Emperor and propagated by his descendants across the seas were widely adopted by both the Ottoman elite and commoners. Diligent study awakened the Rites within the Ottoman heart, with many Confucian principles deeply engraved throughout Ottoman society. The clarion teachings of the 'Expel the Barbarians' faction inflamed the Ottomans. Spreading the Rites to all quarters, civilizing the barbarians, and realizing the grand vision of making all billions under heaven equal to Yao and Shun became the unanimous goal of the entire Ottoman nation.\n\nTwice destroyed, thrice risen. The once-unknown Ottomans have demonstrated extraordinary resilience. The Mongols forced the Turks to submit with blade and horse, but the Ottomans want the Turks to stand up! Failure two hundred years ago matters not, try again one hundred years later; failure one hundred years ago matters not, try again now; failure now matters not, try again in another hundred years! Heeding the teachings of the Great Masters, firmly grasping the book and the sword, it is time to unleash the Kingly Way's conquest and civilizing mission upon all barbarians!"
DD_SEL_1_d: "Unexpectedly, perhaps no one ever thought the weak [Root.GetName] could unite the Turkic tribes of Anatolia. We might have been mere stumbling blocks for the powerful tribes, yet we actually achieved it, like a David versus Goliath victory! The great empire created by the Seljuks of old, we too can replace it! As they retreat into the sands, a new era belonging to us has arrived!\n\nNow, the world no longer remembers the Seljuks, the Ottomans, and their ilk, but knows us, piercing through the name of giants—[Root.GetName]! This is our land, none can question it, none can violate it!"
DD_SEL_1a: "\"Charge, until the dagger of fate pierces my chest, until death parts me from [Root.GetName]!\""
DD_SEL_2_t: "Song of Gold"
DD_SEL_2_d: "\"Constantinople has fallen—Byzantium is no more—\"\n\nLike wildfire, news of Constantinople's fall instantly spread throughout Europe. Shock, disbelief, and incredulity were most people's first reactions. Constantinople, the impregnable city, the final bastion of the Romans, the city of gold and legend, the city desired by the world. This golden land had dissipated like dust in the wind.\n\nSilence, a deathly silence, enveloped the city. Fires burned atop the ruins, corpses lay exposed in the churches, and disease roamed the streets. The incompetence of the Latins, the dark and corrupt government, the chaotic and dangerous court—these had destroyed the city, destroyed the nation. The colossal equestrian statue of Justinian in the forum was once the nation's pride, the world's reverence for a great emperor, the last glimpse of Byzantium's radiant glory, but it had now been dismantled, stripped away for melting, awaiting consumption by the furnace.\n\nThe citizens of Constantinople watched as Justinian departed, gazing at the marks left on the ground by the dragging remnants of the statue's scepter. The sea breeze blew across the Golden Horn. Constantinople, the golden song of Rome, vanished into the tranquil sea wind."
DD_SEL_2a: "\"We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to our own way.\""
