 DD_BRA_1_t:"North German Confederation"
 DD_BRA_1_d:"A catastrophic civil war between north and south has forever torn this nation asunder, while reshaping the order of these northern lands. The war expelled North Germany from the Empire, casting off the authority and chains of the Hohenstaufens. A band of defeated souls, these wounded eagles gradually learned to huddle together for warmth, licking each other's injured wings. The North German Confederation - a loose alliance formed by the northern leaders of the civil war - united to resist the Empire.\n\nBrandenburg, Saxony, and the Hanseatic League, the three most powerful northern princes, became the pillars supporting this alliance. But the war's scars ran deeper in the north than anyone imagined, with each prince harboring their own schemes. Brandenburg's once-mighty military was shattered by the war, though it remained the strongest leader within the alliance, viewed by its partners as a tyrannical bully ever eager to dominate the north; The Hanseatic League symbolized northern wealth, controlling trade across all of North Germany and Central Europe, yet was distrusted as willing to betray anyone for profit; Southernmost Saxony suffered most from the war, but its intricate diplomatic ties earned it suspicion as an imperial spy, with princes viewing it as the Emperor's lapdog.\n\nTo this day, North Germany has not abandoned hopes of revival. To achieve this dream, the alliance must maintain its unity against imperial threats. These lands need a true King in the North to lead its people to victory."

 DD_BRA_2_t:"[From.GetName] Requests to Join the North German Confederation"  
 DD_BRA_2_d:"Due to shifting circumstances, [From.GetName] seeks protection by joining the North German Confederation."  
 DD_BRA_2a:"Welcome them in."  
 DD_BRA_2b:"[From.GetName] is not welcome here."

 DD_BRA_3_d:"[From.GetName] desires to join the North German Confederation and pledges to ensure our safety."  
 DD_BRA_3a:"Together against our foes!"  
 DD_BRA_3b:"They only seek to annex us!"  
 DD_BRA_4_t:"North German Customs Union"
 DD_BRA_4_d:"No matter how great Barbarossa's Empire stood in epic tales, it remains undeniable that the Hohenstaufen's Iron Century was sustained by wealth accumulated through ceaseless trade networks. Venetian merchants from the Adriatic introduced exotic goods to the Empire, while Rhenish caravans delivered wares from across the world throughout Europe. Trade between the Empire and the north formed a crucial pillar of income for imperial princes.\n\nYet the northern rebels were determined to shatter these imperial pillars. The Hanseatic League and all North German princes united to establish the North German Customs Union - a fully integrated system of tariffs, trade, and commercial policies. Through imperial sanctions, toll controls, unified commodity circulation policies, and collective trade alliances, they dealt a devastating economic blow to the Emperor, further accelerating the decline of the Hohenstaufen dynasty."
 DD_BRA_4a:"This will undoubtedly ignite the Empire's wrath."

 DD_BRA_5_t:"The Scourge of the North Sea"
 DD_BRA_5_d:"The ocean - a realm of the unknown and perilous, lands beyond mortal ken. Not so long ago, the Viking peoples of Scandinavia ruled these waves, feared for their terror raids and ghostly appearances. Even Christianized Norsemen offered no guarantee of safety to North Sea merchants, let alone their more savage pagan brethren who still refused conversion. To this day, Viking fleets frequently descend upon North Sea coasts like locust swarms, leaving coastal villages picked clean in their wake.\n\nThese Viking marauders are the North Sea's calamity, a tempest sweeping across the ocean. Their brazen piracy not only devastates the coastlines but draws more outlaws to their ranks. Now, beyond the relative safety of national navies patrolling coastal waters and straits, renegade fleets threaten nearly every shore of the North Sea. This scourge has constricted maritime commerce dramatically, forcing even seaside settlements to retreat inland."
 DD_BRA_5a:"These madmen will face judgment eventually."
 DD_BRA_5a_modifier:"North Sea Reavers"

 DD_BRA_6_t:"The Gathering Storm"
 DD_BRA_6_d:"The fraternal war of a century past cast the North German princes out of the Empire, carving an insurmountable chasm between the northern and southern German peoples. Faith and brotherhood were cast aside, replaced by thirst for vengeance and hunger for power. A scar of division was etched deep into German history, as northerners and southerners came to view each other as foreign enemies rather than kin.\n\nThis tension manifests in the political standoff between Empire and North Germany. With imperial power waning, the northern princes who once tasted bitter defeat now see their chance to end the Hohenstaufen century. United under merchant princes and nobles, the North has transformed from a dying lone wolf into a unified, vengeful force. The victorious South will not surrender its gains to these former subordinates, and as hostility intensifies, a second German Civil War appears imminent."
 DD_BRA_6a:"War seems inevitable."

 DD_BRA_8_d:"A clash between North and South has erupted! Though not yet a full-scale war - merely a localized conflict of interests - all eyes watch with bated breath, knowing the slightest misstep could plunge all of Germany into renewed warfare. The German lands now stand upon a hillside built of gunpowder, awaiting but a spark to ignite half of Europe."

 DD_BRA_9_t:"The Second German Civil War"
 DD_BRA_9_d:"War, war, war! The inconclusive first civil war failed to purge Germany's festering wounds, leaving our people only devastation and scars. These traitors to the German people sold their souls and homeland to demons in pursuit of power and wealth, tearing our nation asunder and dividing brother from brother. Today, we shall end this sin and heal this century-old division.\n\nUnder God's glory, there shall be but one authority in all Germany. Those who divided the fatherland shall be punished; those who threatened German peace shall be crushed. If gentle words and sincere feelings cannot connect beating hearts, then let scorching blood and cold steel do so instead. The Second German Civil War has begun - none may remain neutral. The children of Germany demand an answer!"
 DD_BRA_9a:"We shall fight for the North to the last!"
 DD_BRA_9b:"We shall defend the Emperor's authority!"

 #Upon victory: Gain 50 Imperial Authority. All Electors from opposing faction lose their seats. Emperor cannot demand unlawful territory for 20 years. All victors gain "Victor's Privilege" modifier for 20 years: -20% Aggressive Expansion. If South wins: All Northern princes are dismantled. If North wins: Rejoin the Empire.

 DD_BRA_10_t:"Thaw of Spring"
 DD_BRA_10_d:"Friedrich sat in his armchair, gazing quietly through the window. Though the last snowfall had long passed, stubborn patches of snow refused to melt away. In the shadows of towering buildings, these frostbitten scars clung to the damp earth like scabs on wounded land - a world apart from the sunlit soil just steps away.\n\nNow at last, the radiance of spring has penetrated even these obstinate icy remnants. The lingering winter snow dissolves like running water beneath the warm sunlight. Sitting by the window, Friedrich let the still-chilly spring breeze flutter his empty trouser leg as servants read handwritten news bulletins beside him. Suddenly, hot tears welled uncontrollably in his eyes.\n\nOutside, silvery frost on branches scattered like sand in the spring wind, countless ice crystals glittering like starlight in the vernal glow. The bitter winter has ended - the fires of war extinguished—"
 DD_BRA_10a:"Freedom, justice—and unity!"
