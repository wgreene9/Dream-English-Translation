 DD_BRA_1_d:"A catastrophic civil war between north and south has forever torn this nation asunder, while reshaping the order of these northern lands. The war expelled North Germany from the Empire, casting off the authority and chains of the Hohenstaufens. A band of defeated souls, these wounded eagles gradually learned to huddle together for warmth, licking each other's injured wings. The North German Confederation - a loose alliance formed by the northern leaders of the civil war - united to resist the Empire.\n\nBrandenburg, Saxony, and the Hanseatic League, the three most powerful northern princes, became the pillars supporting this alliance. But the war's scars ran deeper in the north than anyone imagined, with each prince harboring their own schemes. Brandenburg's once-mighty military was shattered by the war, though it remained the strongest leader within the alliance, viewed by its partners as a tyrannical bully ever eager to dominate the north; The Hanseatic League symbolized northern wealth, controlling trade across all of North Germany and Central Europe, yet was distrusted as willing to betray anyone for profit; Southernmost Saxony suffered most from the war, but its intricate diplomatic ties earned it suspicion as an imperial spy, with princes viewing it as the Emperor's lapdog.\n\nTo this day, North Germany has not abandoned hopes of revival. To achieve this dream, the alliance must maintain its unity against imperial threats. These lands need a true King in the North to lead its people to victory."

Trade between the Empire and the north formed a crucial pillar of income for imperial princes.\n\nYet the northern rebels were determined to shatter these imperial pillars. The Hanseatic League and all North German princes united to establish the North German Customs Union - a fully integrated system of tariffs, trade, and commercial policies. Through imperial sanctions, toll controls, unified commodity circulation policies, and collective trade alliances, they dealt a devastating economic blow to the Emperor, further accelerating the decline of the Hohenstaufen dynasty."

To this day, Viking fleets frequently descend upon North Sea coasts like locust swarms, leaving coastal villages picked clean in their wake.\n\nThese Viking marauders are the North Sea's calamity, a tempest sweeping across the ocean. Their brazen piracy not only devastates the coastlines but draws more outlaws to their ranks. Now, beyond the relative safety of national navies patrolling coastal waters and straits, renegade fleets threaten nearly every shore of the North Sea.

A scar of division was etched deep into German history, as northerners and southerners came to view each other as foreign enemies rather than kin.\n\nThis tension manifests in the political standoff between the Empire and North Germany. With imperial power waning, the northern princes who once tasted bitter defeat now see their chance to end the Hohenstaufen century. United under merchant princes and nobles, the North has transformed from a dying lone wolf into a unified, vengeful force. The victorious South will not surrender its gains to these former subordinates, and as hostility intensifies, a second German Civil War appears imminent."

Today, we reunite under the German flag. We need one monarch, one voice, one Germany! The wheels of the German war chariot roll forward. We will tear apart every obstacle on our path to unification. We will seize victory, we will achieve unity—we will reclaim the lands belonging to the German nation!'\n\nThe crowd erupted, their cheers and responses rising like a tsunami in a storm, building a momentum as mighty as mountains.

They can only be solved by iron, and blood. Might makes right, might makes justice. Only upon the edge of the sword shall we obtain the justice that is ours. Germany needs war, Germany needs unification by iron and blood!'\n\nHis tone was forceful and imperious, his voice brooked no doubt, no denial.

To gallop like a knight, to wield a sword like a knight, to live a splendid life like a knight! If only he could become an honorable knight serving the King.\n\nHis captain was quite fond of this simple-minded young lad, perhaps because of the honesty and passion in his eyes, or something else.

Here, it was almost impossible to distinguish the natives from the Germans; people lived together in harmony, the people of Prussia all living their own lives.\n\nOn the hillside near the coast, he finally encountered the one his heart longed for, his lovely fiancée, Helena, the blacksmith's daughter. He smiled shyly at the girl, and was met with an enthusiastic embrace. Held tightly by the girl, Hans felt at a loss. Her love was so fervent, so careful, afraid he might vanish from her grasp. The sea breeze gently caressed them, stirring the warm tears welling in the girl's eyes, stirring the boy's heart. The White Sea witnessed it all; the poem of the sea witnessed the world's beauty and splendor, and also witnessed history and the past scattering with the wind.

He rented the lord's wheat field to put food on the table for his family, occasionally went to the tavern for a few sips of ale, joking and chatting with the older men.

A large number of German immigrants have gradually poured into the Jutland Peninsula, cultivating the long-abandoned fields.\n\nNow, advanced German culture is nurturing this backward little kingdom. German poetry and drama are immensely popular in the Kingdom of Denmark, and the German language and Low German dialects are gradually becoming mainstream in Denmark.

As the successor to the Holy Roman Empire, we are undoubtedly the sole arbiter of Italian affairs.\n\nAlthough the former Holy Roman Empire's territory once extended to Umbria, the incompetent Hohenstaufen family failed to control the Apennine princes, allowing them to slip from the Emperor's grasp.

DD_BRA_87_d: "As the Imperial centralization movement continues to develop, the Chancellor is gradually becoming the bridge between the central government and the regional states. The Kaiser relies increasingly on the Chancellor's ability and connections, to the extent that the Chancellor's office is gradually becoming a new political center in Berlin. This position, whose power is steadily rising, is no longer just a symbol of German state unity and the harmony between monarch and subjects, but a genuine administrative hub.\n\nChecks and balances are becoming a formal norm. The German monarchy has created a dual power structure between the Emperor and the Imperial Diet represented by the Chancellor. The Kaiser still holds supreme powers such as appointing and dismissing the Chancellor, legislation, administration, and judiciary, but the President of the Reichstag, the Chancellor, and the Imperial Chief Justice exercise these powers in the Emperor's name. Although still dominated by the nobility, an increasing number of non-high nobles from the seven major states—such as soldiers, Junkers, major merchants, and factory owners—are gradually entering the Empire's power structure. The Chancellor, elected by the Diet and appointed by the Emperor, has truly become the head of the imperial bureaucracy, the highest leader assisting the Kaiser."

The Archbishop and the Livonian Sword Brothers he leads are undoubtedly the backbone of the German knights' crusade in the Baltic, having withstood wave after wave of pagan counterattacks during the Northern Crusades, standing firm like a stone wall in the heart of the Baltic.\n\nWhen the armies of [Root.GetName] entered the Baltic, the Archbishop sent an urgent letter overnight, proposing to assist us in the Germanization of this wild, primordial land and to lead the pious and brave crusader knights into our service. The terms are naturally simple: the Archbishop of Riga hopes to maintain the diocese's rule over the Baltic."
