DD_SOS_1_t: "Legacy of the First Great Revolt"
DD_SOS_1_d: "Centuries of sins were buried beneath another greater atrocity - whether impulsive, premeditated, inevitable, or compelled, the wailing waves of grief finally overwhelmed the sails and oars of tyranny. With a horn's blast, the Frankish realm crumbled in that unavoidable uprising. The future - our future, the Maghreb's future - seemed within grasp! Yet at the critical moment, 'reluctant' collaborators betrayed the cause, claiming to preserve our nation's survival, instead becoming accomplices to Frankish oppression.\n\nThis betrayal gave the Franks respite. As reinforcements from Christendom arrived, the butchers' blood-stained hooves once again trampled our land, our resistance ending in cacophonous farce. Yet we reversed the tide - the Franks now dare not venture into golden sands, cowering behind coastal towers. Those sins lie buried in forgotten corners with desert winds, vengeful spirits weighing on evildoers' backs, while Frankish banners flutter on towers in Africa's raging winds.\n\nOur rebellion against fate has only just begun."
DD_SOS_1a: "Behold the Tower of Sin shall crumble, When will the Unjust Realm repay its debts?"
DD_SOS_1a_modifier: "Aftermath of the First Muslim Great Revolt"
desc_DD_SOS_1a_modifier: "Ask how the Maghreb came to this. Christians will claim heathens destroyed precious culture they brought. Muslims stay silent, gazing at golden sands as if answers lie there. One certainty remains: §RNone desired this§!. Someday the cries will fade - not from changed hearts or surrendered resistance, but because... everything."
