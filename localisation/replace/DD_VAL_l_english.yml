val_events.1.t:0 "The Valencian Succession Crisis"
val_events.1.d:0 "Two months have passed since Your Majesty's demise, the mourning banners in our cities have not yet faded, while the northern eagles already circle overhead...\n\nSince that fateful St. John's Day in 1213, Valencia has enjoyed forty years of independence. When the stone steps of Barcelona Cathedral were stained with Pedro II's blood, our ancestors seized the opportunity to declare independence, with the city council electing a new ruler.\n\nThough united Valencians repelled Aragonese assaults time and again, unstable succession remained the kingdom's weakness. In 1387, after the previous chancellor's death, Domingo de Borja, an emerging nobleman, ultimately gained leadership through remarkable political acumen. He skillfully controlled the council and smoothly transferred the throne to his son Alfonso. Under King Alfonso's wise rule, we not only gained formal recognition from Aragon but achieved unprecedented prosperity—our ports bustled with activity, silk and citrus trade flourished, and no merchant in the Mediterranean was unfamiliar with Valencia's banner.\n\nYet fate is ever cruel. The sudden death of Alfonso's sole heir Fernando struck like lightning, leaving not just an irreplaceable void but drawing covetous gazes from the north.\n\nAn Aragonese prince has already sent envoys claiming 'natural right' to Valencia's throne based on ancient treaties and blood ties. He even arrogantly demands the city council swear immediate allegiance and prepare for his arrival.\n\nThe council stands more divided than ever: while most councilors advocate paying increased tribute for peace, others long discontent with Borja rule secretly maintain contacts with Aragon seeking to overthrow the regime."

val_events.2.d:0 "The long-simmering unrest has finally exploded into open conflict, tearing apart the heart of [Root.GetName]. The flames of civil war now rage across the realm, as royalist forces and rebel uprisings battle fiercely in every province—our once-glorious achievements reduced to scorched earth.\n\nEven more chilling, those ungrateful vassals have seized the opportunity to betray us, shamelessly tearing up their oaths of fealty and raising their old banners in defiance. Their once-sweet pledges now ring hollow, and our weakness has become their chance for freedom.\n\nThe dream of a unified Iberia, along with our glory, has crumbled overnight. Lands that once flourished are now battlefields—cities plundered, farmlands burned. The central authority has collapsed, our demoralized armies are stretched thin, and despair spreads among the people. Valencia, an empire that once reached its zenith, now teeters on the brink of total ruin. How can we possibly endure?"

val_events.3.t:0 "Aragon's Commercial Levy"
val_events.3.d:0 "Though we expelled the Aragonese who sought to rule us and established a republic belonging to the Valencian people, these power-hungry schemers now make another vexing demand—an annual commercial tax as 'compensation' for 'protecting' the Republic of Valencia.\n\nTo outsiders, this may seem a reasonable request, but we know the truth: the King of Aragon, bitterly regretting his failure to claim Valencia's throne, now seeks to weaken us through economic means, grasping for the consolation he was denied. We have every right to refuse this scoundrel's demand, yet doing so would antagonize the Kingdom of Aragon, giving our fledgling republic a formidable new enemy.\n\nHow shall we respond to this extortionate tax?"

val_events.3.aa:0 "We have no choice."

val_events.6.t:0 "The Catalan Uprising"
val_events.6.d:0 "Our eastern neighbors are now rising up in rebellion - the same struggle we once waged against Aragonese tyranny... The peasants of Catalonia can no longer endure the exploitation and oppression of their king and nobles. They have mobilized, forming the Redemption Farmers' League to systematically resist unjust taxes and other vile, cruel abuses against the peasantry.\n\nAs a republic that successfully won independence and abolished monarchy, we have a duty to strongly support our Catalan brothers who share our ideals. The League's representatives have already crossed our border seeking aid - and for our republic, this presents a perfect opportunity to rightfully incorporate Catalonia into our glorious republic.\n\nThe League's fate now lies in our hands. Without sufficient support, the peasants' defeat is nearly inevitable. We could generously provide full assistance, or simply watch from the sidelines until Aragon's situation becomes irreparable before deciding our next move..."

val_events.6.aa:0 "Give them full support."

val_events.12.aa:0 "Splendid!"

val_events.13.t:0 "Iberia's Manifest Destiny?"
val_events.13.d:0 "Having ended the corrupt and incompetent rule of Aragon, we find the Iberian skies still shrouded in shadows of unrest and turmoil. The endless conflicts between Christian kingdoms and Moorish realms, coupled with internal strife and despicable court intrigues, continue to tear apart this blood-soaked land, draining the lifeblood of Iberian people and extinguishing their last hopes for peace.\n\nThrough decisive action, we Valencians have proven our ability to reject tyrannical rule and achieve complete self-determination, attaining internal prosperity and stability. Perhaps we should extend this prosperity to all Iberians yearning for freedom... This may well be our manifest destiny - an urgent calling to unify Iberia under a great republic.\n\nAlternatively, we could remain content in our corner, focusing solely on our own stability and prosperity, indifferent to the tragic fates of our pitiable neighbors - this too would be an understandable choice."
val_events.13.aa:0 "The die is cast."
val_events.13.aa.d:0 "§RThis will undoubtedly be a difficult path§!\n"
val_events.13.bb:0 "This seems far too idealistic."

val_events.14.t:0 "A New Hope"
val_events.14.d:0 "The sound of trumpets echoed through the marble halls of Valencia's parliament, heralding the arrival of the young man. Cesare Borgia, son of Rodrigo, entered the court dressed in luxurious black silk, his eyes revealing boundless ambition and cunning.\n\n'My father's enemies in parliament call us the Viper Clan,' Cesare said with a barely perceptible smile, 'but they forget - under Valencia's sun, even a viper may become king.'\n\nCesare brought with him loyal mercenaries, French gold, and countless dangerous secrets. The nobles who once mocked Rodrigo's ambitions now felt chills down their spines as father and son stood united. Some called him cruel and warlike, others praised his strategic brilliance, but all agreed on one thing - the Borgias' game had only just begun.\n\nCesare was both lion and fox. Now this scion of House Borgia stood ready to serve his father's kingdom, prepared to expand Valencia's domains through iron and blood, lies and intrigue.\n\nShould we embrace this gifted but dangerous prince, or guard against his insatiable thirst for power? This decision will shape Valencia's destiny."
val_events.14.aa:0 "Let him succeed me."
val_events.14.bb:0 "He's still too young."

val_events.15.t:0 "The Councillors' Protest"

val_events.15.ee:0 "Just more empty talk."

val_events.16.t:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s Triumphant Return"
val_events.16.d:0 "The Lion Banner now flies over every inch of land from the Pyrenees to Gibraltar! From the rugged Galician coast to the sun-drenched Andalusian plains, from the vast plateaus of Castile to Portugal's oceanic gateways - the entire Iberian Peninsula now basks in Valencia's glory.\n\nThis is the victory of our great [Root.Monarch.GetName], and of every brave Valencian soldier and loyal citizen. Four centuries ago, our ancestors seized opportunity from Barcelona's bloodshed to win Valencia's independence. Today, we stand not just independent, but as Iberia's hegemon, the Mediterranean's lion!\n\nIn [Root.Capital.GetName], triumph day has come. Streets are carpeted with flowers and laurel leaves, the crowds' cheers deafening. Captured kings and princes parade in chains, their former banners paling beneath Valencia's Lion Standard. Envoys from distant lands witness our might in awe, while our trade partners foresee an unprecedented era of prosperity. Valencia, once a struggling minor state on the Mediterranean's edge, has become an undisputed empire!"
val_events.16.aa:0 "Long live the Emperor!"

val_events.17.t:0 "Disaster Emerges"
val_events.17.d:0 "The sudden demise of our great conqueror has plunged [Root.Country.GetName] into an abyss. His mountain-like authority was the sole force binding together our vast Iberian dominions - but with his fall, this power instantly dissolved, exposing the unhealed fractures at our empire's foundation.\n\nIn newly conquered territories, the deeply rooted cultures, languages and traditions remain fundamentally alien to Valencia. Now, like gears losing their driving force, the colossal machinery of empire has ground to a halt - and begun moving backward.\n\nFrom all directions come whispers of rebellion: disappointed nobles rekindle restorationist ambitions, oppressed religious minorities rise up in arms, trade routes grow perilous amidst collapsing order, and [Root.Capital.GetName]'s once-bustling port now decays. Valencia, which once advanced triumphantly, now sinks into quagmire, with every vassal's loyalty severely tested. We must act swiftly, or our imperial glory will vanish like a shooting star."
val_events.17.aa:0 "We shall endure!"

val_events.18.t:0 "Integration Plan for Christian States"
val_events.18.d:0 "As the smoke of civil war clears, the suppressed centrifugal forces have been laid bare. Though we've successfully replanted Valencia's banners across these lands, the non-dominant Christian provinces remain skeptical of Valencian rule.\n\nHistorical and cultural differences, compounded by the pains of recent civil war, have created deep divides between these regions and ourselves. We can no longer rely solely on military force to maintain superficial unity. A crucial choice lies before us: should we attempt to bridge these divides and truly embrace them as part of the Iberian family, or continue using coercive measures to enforce compliance, treating them merely as conquests to be exploited? This decision will determine not only the empire's stability, but also Valencia's future role in these lands."

val_events.19.t:0 "Integration Plan for Muslim Populations"
val_events.19.d:0 "The history of Iberian conquest is inseparable from the 'Reconquista' against Muslims. Yet even under our rule, the Islamic provinces remain distinct enclaves. With their own faith, language and way of life, they stand apart from our dominant culture. During our late king's reign, their discontent was suppressed by military might, but in the civil war they stirred restlessly, even plotting independence.\n\nNow in this post-crisis era, we must reconsider how to handle these unique communities. Should we follow historical precedents of harsh measures - forced conversion, cultural assimilation, or outright expulsion to achieve permanent homogeneity? This may eliminate threats but could bring unbearable social upheaval and economic damage. Or might we find a gentler path, permitting some preservation of their identity in exchange for loyalty and contributions to the state? This choice defines Valencia's imperial character and our future image across Iberia and the Mediterranean."
val_events.19.aa:0 "Encourage their conversion"

val_events.21.t:0 "The Final Reform"
val_events.21.d:0 "In Valencia's palace council chamber, candlelight illuminated [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s grim countenance as the parliamentarians' clamor gradually fell silent.\n\n'Gentlemen, I granted you the right to speak, yet received only obstruction and contempt in return,' [Root.Monarch.GetName] rose slowly, his ominous visage striking fear, 'Valencia needs not endless debate, but decisive action.'\n\nAs [Root.Monarch.GetName] stepped from the shadows flanked by loyal guards, the most radical opponents realized their cause was lost. The day the Borgias had meticulously planned had arrived—the 'Royal Prerogative Act' was proclaimed, abolishing parliamentary veto over military and fiscal matters, establishing a privy council answering solely to the monarch, and placing regional governorships under Borgia loyalists.\n\n'You may choose allegiance or departure,' [Root.Monarch.GetName] gazed at the rising dawn beyond the windows, his voice calm yet implacable, 'but Valencia's future shall be written by my hand.'\n\nCity whispers tell of twelve opposition leaders dying suddenly in their homes that night, allegedly after sharing a special Borgia vintage. By morning, remaining councilors swore allegiance to the new order.\n\nThe Borgia reforms are now irreversible. Valencia embarks on a path toward unity and expansion, though power's price is ever measured in blood and terror."

val_events.24.d:0 "In the deepest chambers of Valencia's palace, within a secret study, [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s fingers traced the edges of a long-forgotten parchment. In the candlelight, his eyes gleamed with undisguised ambition.\n\n'The bishops believed the papal documents were mere historical relics,' Rodrigo smiled as he spoke to his son Cesare, 'but within these ancient inks, I've found the key to Valencia's ascension.'\n\nEnvoys from Rome brought documents 'discovered' in the Vatican Archives - purportedly a decree from Constantine the Great's era recognizing Spanish Christian leaders' rights to inherit certain territories after Rome's fall. Carefully selected archaeologists and theologians were summoned to 'authenticate' these claims.\n\nSome call it forgery, others proclaim it truth.

When an elderly cardinal attempted protest, his words choked into silence as he clutched his chest and collapsed.\n\n'It seems God has made His will known,' [Root.Monarch.GetName] sighed, signaling servants to remove the cardinal's cup, 'Let us pray no further divine interventions are required.'\n\nWhen ecclesiastical authority bows to temporal power, even God must hold His tongue."

Rising to face the assembled nobility, his gaze swept over the furious Holy Roman delegates and terrified French ambassadors.\n\n'Rome once ruled the known world, and we shall restore that glory,' proclaimed the newly crowned Emperor, clutching the Borgia standard, 'The Mediterranean shall again be Rome's lake, and our enemies shall kneel before the Eagle!'\n\nBeyond the walls, legions in scarlet-and-black uniforms marched in formation, their serpent banners snapping in the wind. From Sicily to Iberia, from North Africa to Constantinople, the world witnessed the dawn of a new era.\n\nThe Roman Empire rose anew from the fires of Borgia ambition.

Our territories span from the Pyrenees to every corner of the Mediterranean, all echoing Valencia's name.\n\nYet this grand expansion reveals growing flaws: our antiquated city-council governance model from independence days proves inadequate for such scale. Weak centralization, inefficient local administration, delayed decree dissemination, and half-hearted compliance from regional magnates and newly incorporated cultures - what once brought success now shackles true unification and prosperity.\n\nHistory's bloody lessons teach us that empires relying on personal charisma or military suppression inevitably crumble. For Valencia's enduring stability, we must courageously examine and reform our grassroots governance structure. How to ensure central authority while energizing localities? How to effectively implement policies in our remotest villages? This transcends mere administrative changes - it's a profound transformation determining our empire's future trajectory.

val_events.43.d:0 "The ceaseless flow of West African gold into [Root.GetName]'s treasury surges like a molten tide. This unprecedented wealth could excite any nation, while charting a new course for Valencia's future.\n\nYet such vast reserves breed policy divisions. Some advocate investing in trade - transforming gold into commodities and capital to stimulate domestic economy, expand our commercial networks, and cement Valencia as Mediterranean (indeed global) trade hub. They believe circulating gold maximizes its value and ensures lasting prosperity.\n\nOthers view gold as national power's symbolic reserve, requiring strict control. They warn excessive market influx could trigger inflation, harming commoners' livelihoods and long-term stability. They propose reserving gold for military emergencies or infrastructure, not free circulation.\n\nNow we must decide how this golden deluge will shape Valencia: commercial expansion's catalyst, or national security's bedrock?"

val_events.45.d:0 "Chronic instability, endless infighting, and disregard for the people's will have finally plunged Valencia into the abyss. Our once-proud government institutions, weakened by sustained instability, now crumble completely. Corruption spreads like cancer, decrees fail beyond the capital, rebellions erupt everywhere, and the people suffer unbearably.\n\nThis collapse came not overnight, but through years of accumulated failures. Our formidable armies now wander aimlessly with broken morale, prosperous trade networks lie in ruins from chaos, and once-united citizens turn to resistance in despair. The Valencia that conquered Iberia, reached the Near East, and amassed golden wealth - that empire exists no more.\n\nAmid endless chaos and despair, the old order has dissolved completely, royal authority vanished without trace. This marks the bloody, tragic end of an error-filled historical chapter. Though the old empire perishes, its downfall brings new possibilities to these tormented lands. Valencia's story may yet continue - but in a radically different form."

val_events.46.d:0 "Valencia's rise was forged by steel and blood. Yet after expansion and civil war, our military structure reveals critical flaws. Traditional levies struggle with large-scale conflicts, while overreliance on individual heroism leaves forces vulnerable when leaders fall. Across Europe, military thought and technology undergo profound changes.\n\nShould we follow Alpine examples, using our golden wealth to hire seasoned mercenaries whose flexibility and expertise complement our standing forces? Or learn from past mistakes by investing in loyal, disciplined regular troops to ensure stable core strength? Perhaps we should refine Valencia's own martial traditions into something unique? Some even suggest focusing resources elsewhere, as not all problems yield to force.\n\nA fierce debate rages about Valencia's military future - in court and beyond.

The heir's education and selection of royal advisors represent century-defining decisions. We can no longer rely solely on innate talent for our successors, nor concentrate power among few factions.\n\nBefore us lies a profound dilemma: Should we emulate ancient empires by gathering Europe's brightest minds to comprehensively educate the heir, ensuring he can navigate increasingly complex state affairs? Or take the pragmatic path, acknowledging our dependence on experienced old-guard families, securing their loyalty through shared power and privileges?\n\nBuilding a power structure that both stabilizes the crown and attracts exceptional talent stands among Valencia's most pressing challenges. This represents a difficult choice balancing trust, merit, and power equilibrium."

val_events.48.t:0 "Our Italian Holdings"
val_events.48.d:0 "As Valencia's influence extends beyond Iberia, our Italian territories stand as vital symbols of imperial reach. These provinces boast rich history, culture, and resources - geographically distant yet politically bound to Valencia. Managing these unique lands to become imperial assets rather than burdens presents our current challenge.\n\nSome argue these territories should become crown possessions under centralized rule, funneling taxes directly to the treasury and fully integrating them into our administration. This would maximize royal profits and control while ensuring absolute loyalty from strategic holdings. Others contend Italy's ingrained city-republic traditions and complex politics demand looser governance. Granting greater autonomy and commercial freedom under Valencian suzerainty might better stimulate prosperity, minimize unrest, and ensure long-term harmony.\n\nOur choice will shape these lands' future and their contributions to Valencia's empire."
val_events.48.aa:0 "They shall remain crown property."

Yet the Borgias' ambitions reach far beyond Valencia's throne alone. We know true fulfillment comes only by ending these divided realms and bringing all Iberia under Valencia's rule. This is more than military conquest - it's a political declaration that we alone are God's chosen, the sole legitimate bearers of the 'Iberian Mandate'.

VAL_expansion_missions_13_desc:0 "The Kingdom of France - that self-proclaimed European hegemon - stands as an inevitable obstacle to our expansion. While direct military confrontation would prove costly, we may exploit its internal fractures. The French crown's long suppression of its vassals has bred discontent among dukes, counts, and cities alike. Through clandestine diplomacy and financial support, we can fan these embers of resentment into flames of independence. Encouraging these fiefdoms to break from the French crown would severely deplete the king's military and financial resources, keeping him preoccupied with internal revolts.

VAL_admin_missions_2_desc:0 "Valencia's domain now stretches far beyond its origins as a coastal city-state. From the Pyrenees to every Mediterranean shore, our name resounds. Yet this grand expansion reveals systemic flaws - our antique city-council governance, inherited from independence days, proves inadequate for such scale. Weak centralization, inefficient local administration, delayed decree dissemination, and half-hearted compliance from regional magnates and newly incorporated cultures have turned past successes into present shackles, hindering true unification and prosperity. History's bloody lessons teach us that empires relying on personal charisma or military suppression inevitably crumble. For Valencia's enduring stability, we must courageously reform our grassroots governance structure. How to ensure central authority while energizing localities? How to effectively implement policies in our remotest villages? This transcends mere administrative changes - it's a profound transformation determining our empire's future course. The time for reform has come; we must take this step."

VAL_admin_missions_6_title:0 "A Dynamic System"
VAL_admin_missions_6_desc:0 "A powerful empire requires not just stable authority, but vibrant institutions.
