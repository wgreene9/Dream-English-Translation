DD_NSE_1_t: "The Collapse of an Empire"
DD_NSE_1_d: "An empire that relies solely on military power, built on the submission and blood of the conquered, is destined not to last. Without an ambitious and capable leader, the efforts of generations will be like a small boat adrift on the vast sea, quickly overturned and destroyed by the waves of time.\n\nThe current ruler of the North Sea Empire, Olaf III, values art and his 'artistic sentiments' more than the legacy of his ancestors and the vast empire spanning the North Sea. His incompetence and corruption have easily hollowed out the fragile foundation of the empire, which was barely maintained by several capable kings through their lifetimes. He has swiftly led the empire and his own fate into an abyss of eternal darkness and destruction.\n\nThe vast empire, like a solitary reef in the North Sea, is battered and eroded by waves of turmoil. The nobles, following the example of the foolish king, ignore the interconnected disasters and chaos, focusing only on their wealth and status. The governor of the Danelaw in Britain is plotting independence, while the long-oppressed Swedes, praying for Odin's aid, are eager to unleash their vengeful fury upon the Christian world, which they see as filthy and blasphemous...\n\nThe spark that ignited all this happened on an ordinary afternoon. The setting sun cast its dim yellow light on the curtains of the imperial court, glinting off the soldiers' armor and sharpened spear blades. The coup forces quickly occupied all the important places in the court—the armory, the storerooms, the inner chambers... Only the exhibition hall, filled with priceless art treasures, remained untouched by bloodshed. For inside, the king, cursed and despised by almost all his subjects, lingered, unwilling to part with these treasures, as rotten and decayed as his own heart.\n\n'Ah, please bury my body here. With these artworks by my side, I can die without regret,' Olaf III uttered his last words before drawing his sword and cleanly slitting his own throat.\n\nAs the king lay in a pool of blood, he seemed to see his ancestors, Canute and Harald, gazing down from heaven. But their eyes held not the expected anger, only a deep, sea-like pity and sorrow..."

DD_NSE_2_t: "Silence"
DD_NSE_2_d: "The eve of a storm is often calm, and those accustomed to peace often lack the ability and mindset to deal with turmoil.\n\nThe Danelaw in Britain was granted a high degree of autonomy. Its ruler lacked only the title of king and owed allegiance to the North Sea Empire's monarch. Since Olaf III, obsessed with art, ascended the throne and drastically reduced the empire's standing army, the governor of the Danelaw has increasingly shown an ambiguous attitude toward the king's commands... He was merely waiting for the perfect opportunity.\n\nThe weather in Britain is always drizzly. The governor stood by the window, gazing anxiously into the distance. The vast ocean to the east seemed to be brewing an unprecedented storm. The seemingly ordinary drizzle now felt like a harbinger of the storm about to descend upon every citizen of the Danelaw, including himself.\n\nIt had been a long, long time since an imperial envoy arrived with the king's edict—so long that the mahogany table in the reception hall was covered in a thin layer of dust. Governor [Root.Monarch.GetName] knew what this meant. As the leader of the Danelaw, he had to be prepared, even if what lay ahead was a cataclysmic crisis and disaster."

DD_NSE_3_t: "The Wrath of Odin"
DD_NSE_3_d: "Pale lightning flashed through the dense clouds, and the howling north wind swept up misty vapors. Raindrops the size of beans struck the furious faces of Viking warriors. Their roars, the clash of weapons, and endless slaughter were all unleashed upon the long-suffering land of Sweden.\n\nThe North Sea Empire, which claimed to rule all of Scandinavia, was a cunning and greedy nation that had forsaken the great Odin and converted to the false Christian faith. Now, having lost the protection of their false god, the empire is in decline. We can finally launch an unprecedented large-scale uprising to end the cursed rule of these Christians, reclaim our homeland, liberate our people, and restore our faith.\n\nThe fragile rule of the Christians will come to an end. The destruction of the North Sea Empire is just the beginning. The wrath of Odin and the old gods will descend upon all lands where the so-called name of the Lord is sung in churches. We have risen again, and we will surge like the turbulent North Sea, creating massive waves across Europe!"
DD_NSE_3a: "Forward! Reclaim our homeland! Drive out the Christians!"
DD_NSE_3a_modifier: "Ragnarok"
DD_NSE_4_t: "Long-Planned"
DD_NSE_4_d: "As the North Sea Empire descends into irreversible chaos, the conquered peoples of Britain seem to see an opportunity to regain their freedom—without the aid of the fierce Norse armies from Scandinavia, the collapse of the entire Danelaw is only a matter of time.\n\nThe English, Scots, and Welsh, once bitter enemies, have come together against a common foe, tacitly agreeing to 'cooperate' with each other.\n\nThough each has their own agenda, these former enemies have set aside past grievances to unite in an attempt to overthrow us, destroy the legacy of Harald the Great that has shone for centuries, and ignite a wave of rebellion that will shake the entire North Sea and northern Europe.\n\nOh, eternal Lord, we beg You to look upon this world showing signs of apocalyptic doom and hear the prayers of Your faithful struggling against darkness and chaos. Guide us to end this long night of calamity and bring forth a new dawn..."
DD_NSE_4a: "The great tide of turmoil has risen. Where will we go from here?"
